## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Nigeria has called upon emergency powers to deal with COVID-19 without, however, having declared a state of emergency. The extant Infectious Diseases Law - the Quarantine Act 1926 - gives the President sweeping powers towards preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases' and to make regulations for associated purposes. However, the Quarantine Act has been in process of being repealed and substituted via a new Bill of health.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: Quarantine Act of 1926

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: Quarantine Act of 1926

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: Quarantine Act of 1926

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: Quarantine Act of 1926

 

*Comments*:
 The National Assembly of Nigeria has proposed to replace the Quarantine Act of 1926 with new legislation (separately tabled in each house), but these bills are still pending. Thus, the Quarantine Act of 1926 is the current main legal instrument to allow the president to make Covid-19 related regulations.

*Comments*:
 The government initially declared a 14-day period of emergency measures but these have been periodically extended. From 04 May the restrictions got gradually eased but curfews remained in place from 10pm-6am across all of Nigeria. On 04 September, Nigeria entered the third phase of eased lockdown which was planned to last four weeks. On 19 October, the measures were extended for four weeks and I found no evidence that they were extended further, therefore emend is coded as 16 November 2020. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control still lists limits on gatherings of over 20 people outside of workplaces; however, no other national-level restrictions from the original regulations are listed. The Nigerian CDC also issued a set of guidelines for end-of-year travel. These include mandatory testing and quarantine (7 days) for travelers entering the country, but no formal restrictions on movement or public gatherings. In January, the lockdown was extended for 4 weeks. Phase IV of lockdown was instituted on 10 May 2021 and end by the time of coding on 11 June 2021. Limitations come and go with the new developments and waves of the pandemic.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Several journalists have been harassed, arrested, and had their cameras taken or destroyed while covering lockdown enforcements and other government covid-19 measures. On 03 August a journalist was attacked by police forces while covering officers enforcing COVID-19 restrictions.  On 24 October, a journalist was arrested after conducting "interviews in the north Lagos suburb of Agege, where residents had massed outside a government warehouse with the aim of taking food they believd to be stored here for alleviating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic" (1), and a week later he was found dead with a gunshot on his body.

Some states have passed a new law, prohibiting publishing "false and damaging" information, which puts limitation on reporting on Covid-19, including on the government's response to Covid-19. In 2021 the media environment continues to harass and arrest journalists.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 A reporter was arrested and accused of publishing "false and damaging" information, which violated the Covid-19 law. Ebonyi state governor said that the reporter lied in a recent report he wrote on Lassa fever outbreak in the state.

As part of public health restrictions on assembly, 92 journalists had their access to the presidential villa suspended. Effectively stopping them from covering government press briefings. Since I did not find evidence of the violations discontinuing, merepoth is coded as 1 in all time periods.

There are reports that journalist were excluded from a hearing of the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes, however, this restriction was not with reference to the pandemic.

Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing.

 "Nigerian Information Minister Lai Mohammed said that journalists would be required to carry a valid identity card to move around in the two southwestern states of Lagos and Ogun, as well as in the capital Abuja, as part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s lockdowns in those areas, which were imposed on March 29" (1) and the authorities in Nigeria have decided to limit access to the president's office to a handful of media outlets that are nearly all controlled by the government or supportive of it. Since I did not find evidence of the violations discontinuing, merepoth is coded as 1 in all time periods.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents verbally harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 March-June: A journalist Saint Meinpamo Onitsha was intimidated and questioned for hours over a Covid-19 related article. He was coerced to apologize for his reporting.
Kufre Carter was arrested and prosecuted for  writing an article that was “false” and contained “defamatory words against” the state's Health Commissioner. 

July-September, October-December, January-March, April-June: since two cases from March-June appear to be isolated incidents and I found no further information on similar violations, mevhar is coded as 0 in these time periods.

## Physical harassment of journalists (*mephar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents physically harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

*Comments*:
 Journalists covering covid-19 related issues have been physically attacked by police. On 03 August a journalist was attacked by police forces while covering officers' enforcing COVID-19 restrictions. On 24 October, a journalist was arrested after conducting "interviews in the north Lagos suburb of Agege, where residents had massed outside a government warehouse with the aim of taking food they believed to be stored here for alleviating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic" (1), and a week later he was found dead with a gunshot on his body. According to RSF, “Nigeria is now one of West Africa’s most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists, who are often spied on, attacked, arbitrarily arrested or even killed” (1). Since there were several violations and assaults on journalists are common, violations likely continue and mephar is coded as 1 in all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The Nigerian government is importing a herbal "miracle medicine" from Madagascar, which has been advised by the WHO not to cure Covid-19. However, contrary to several other countries that import the herbal drink, Nigerian officials and the president say the drink will be subjected to strict clinical testing for verification of its effect before it's released to the public. Based on the testing decision, importing this drink is not included in the score. 

Otherwise, the government Covid-19 information is similar to that of the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

*Comments*:
 There are several reports of police violence related to the beginning of the enforcement of the lockdown, in which several people were killed. Police officers who enforced coronavirus restriction measures allegedly harassed and raped women as well. Since many cases of violations were observed and I found no evidence of violations discontinuing, pomviol is coded as 3 in all time periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 The Nigerian army denied rumours that they would enforce lockdown, later sources, however, state that the army has been involved in violent and deadly lockdown enforcements. Since I found no evidence of discontinuation of military involvement in enforcing confinement measures, milinv is coded as 1 in all time periods.
