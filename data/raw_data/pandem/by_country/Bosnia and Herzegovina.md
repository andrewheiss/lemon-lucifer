## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

 Emergency situations introduced separately on 16 March 2020 in the Bosniak-Croat Federation (state of disaster) and the Serb Republic (state of emergency); nationwide state of disaster introduced on 17 March 2020, as announced in the Official Gazette of BiH, No. 18/20. Nationwide state of disaster ended on 31 May and since then I found no measures taken at the federal level since then.

 Q2 2020: Own English translation: Law on Protection and Rescue of People and Material Goods from Natural or Other Disasters in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Article 13, point h). The law gives the Council of Ministers (the executive on the national level) the power to declare a state of natural or other disaster. Note on subnational variation: legal instrument to declare a state of emergency in the Serb Republic is Article 8 of the Law on Protection and Rescue in Emergency Situation (Decision published in Official Gazette 25/20, (1)). The legal instruments to declare a state of disaster in the Bosniak-Croat Federation are Law on the Government of the Federation of BiH (Article 19, paragraph 2),  Article 24, Item 11 of the Law on Protection and Rescue of People and Material Goods from Natural and Other Disasters,  Article 32 of the Rulebook on the Manner of Work and functioning of staffs and commissioners of civil protection (Decision published in the Official Gazette of the Federation of BiH», No. 21/20, (2))

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: 31 May 2020 corresponds to the end of the state of disaster in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the subnational entities). In the Serb Republic the state of emergency was lifted on earlier on 21 May 2020. I have not found any documents indicating the end of the state of disaster at the federal level, but it is logical to code it as having ended since it was lifted in both subnational entities. Moreover, Federal Civil Protection Headquarters has not issued any new orders for Covid-19 measures since 31 May 2020.  For example, from the OSCE report: "The Republika Srpska declared a state of emergency on the basis of Art. 70 of the Constitution as of 3 April, which ended on 21 May, while the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of natural or other disaster on 17 March, on the basis of the Framework Lawon Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH, which ended on 31 May."

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

 Q4 2020: The Lipa temporary emergency camp was set up in April 2020 as part of the emergency measures and according to Human Rights Watch, "Conditions in the Lipa temporary emergency camp were poor before the fire, with a lack of basic services including critical hygiene and sanitation services such as sewage and running water." (1) The camp was not connected to the water and electricity supplies, although the government promised  to do so in April 2020. The conditions in the Lipa camp deteriorated in the winter and according to Amnesty International, "in the last days of December, around 900 migrants and asylumseekers were stranded in inhumane conditions and without access to food, water or electricity in the temporary camp Lipa after the authorities failed to agree to their relocation to more suitable facilities in other parts of the country." (2) This can be considered a violation of Art. 7 of the ICCPR.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 On 20 April 2020, the police detained TV journalists (for a short period of time). The journalists were reporting on a situation in a covid-19 isolation center and the police deleted the footage from their phones.  Since it was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepgov is coded as 0 in Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing.

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: There are reports that authorities avoid answering journalists' questions related to the pandemic and that the opportunities to ask questions by the media are limited. Moreover, "On 7 April 2020, the government of the Federation of  Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision restricting access to press conferences for the media. The decision stipulates that only three media representatives can be present at press conferences given by the Crisis Management Headquarters." (1, OSCE report, p.54). 

According to the US Department of State,  "Sarajevo-based journalists filed a complaint to the FMHL in March because local authorities had limited the possibility of asking questions at press conferences and additional updates about COVID-related issues. In April a group of journalists reported to the FMLH that the press office of University of Sarajevo Clinical Center did not treat media even handedly and that the general manager shared information with selected outlets only. The Federation’s (COVID-19) crisis headquarters as well as crisis headquarters in Herzegovina Neretva Canton and Sarajevo Canton adopted decisions that banned some journalists from attending press conferences, claiming it was a heath protection measure." (2)

Coded as 1 since the decision applies to one subnational entity and not the whole country.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: I have not found any limitations on media access to Covid-19 information.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 The presidency ordered the Defense Forces to establish tents at the borders for the enforcement of quarantine for citizens entering the country, which is not coded since these are not coercive measures. No new information found since June 2020.
