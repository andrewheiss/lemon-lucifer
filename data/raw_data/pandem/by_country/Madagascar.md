## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Madagascar declared a State of Health Emergency on 21 March 2020, initially for 2 weeks, based on:
Constitution, article 61; (1)
Law no 91-011 of 18 July 1991 relating to emergency situations; (2) 
Law no 2011-002 of 15 July 2011 on the Public Health Code; (4). 

The state of health emergency was being renewed consecutively since its introduction until it was lifted on 18 October 2020 (6).

During half of Q4 2020 and Q1 of 2021, there were some social distancing measures in place (see 7,8). 

On 3 April 2021 the authorities reinstated the state of health emergency with Decree N°2021-390, based on the same legal instruments as in Q2,Q3 and Q4 of 2020 (see the government decree: 9, and 10).

Article 61, Constitution (1): ''...the President of the Republic may proclaim on all or on part of the national territory, the situation of exception, the state of urgency, the state of necessity or martial law. The decision is made by the President of the Republic in the Council of Ministers, after the opinion of the Presidents of the National Assembly, of the Senate and of the High Constitutional Court.''

''Art. 2 law 91-011, 1991 (2) - The emergency situation, the state of national necessity of the martial law is proclaimed by decree taken in the Council of Ministers, after opinion of the High Constitutional Court and the President of the National People's Assembly. 
Art. 3 - The exceptional situation is limited in time. It may however be extended in the same forms, by periods which may not each exceed the initial period. It ends automatically as of the expiration of the deadline, unless it is terminated before, by decree taken in the Council of Ministers.''
Art. 16 - The duration of the emergency situation is fifteen days. It may be extended under the conditions provided for in article 3 of this law.''

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

Article 61, Constitution: ''...The proclamation of the situation of exception confers on the President of the Republic special powers of which the extent and the duration are established by an organic law.From the proclamation of one of the situations of exception aforesaid, the President of the Republic can legislate by way of ordinance on the matters that arise within the domain of the law.

Art. 4, law 91-011, 1991- The proclamation of an exceptional situation confers on the President of the Republic of the special powers necessary by the circumstances for which it was proclaimed and puts at his disposal all the civil and military means likely to be implemented for this effect.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

The state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020 and reinstated on 3 April 2021. Some areas during Q2 of 2021 were subjected to extra confinement measures.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

 The text of the Law  n ° 91-011 of 18 July 1991 (1)  relating to exceptional situations, mentions:
Art. 17 - The proclamation of the emergency situation automatically confers on the President of the Republic the power, by regulatory means:
                6. To take all measures to ensure the control of the press of publications and broadcasts of all kinds and to prohibit those which are likely to disturb public order or endanger national unity;

The Decree N ° 2020 –359 of 21 March 2020 proclaiming a state of health emergency (2), mentions:
Article 4.- The Minister of National Defense...... the Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Development, the Minister of Communication and Culture,......are each responsible as far as he is concerned, of the execution of this decree.

''...the Malagasy authorities have taken some of the most restrictive measures for the media in Africa. Radio stations and television channels are obliged to broadcast official information on the coronavirus, under penalty of sanction. This directive should not be subject to any restriction on the information that the media may publish according to the Minister of Communication. Free-to-air programs giving voice to listeners were also banned as part of the state of health emergency.'' (3) 

The Madagascan authorities, responding to accusations of restricting media freedoms (see more on this on the following media variables), said:
"The press is one of the services that are automatically requisitioned" (3) 

According to the Minister of Communication Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy: "There is absolutely no restriction of their freedom of expression per se, but - it is true and we assume it, because that is the law which authorizes and which says it - the press is part of the services that are requisitioned as part of a state of emergency . So we ask all the media in Madagascar to disseminate information on everything related to the coronavirus without asking them for any restriction in the information they can publish." (3) 

The state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020, therefore also the media limitations based on it. 

The state of emergency was reinstated on 3 April 2021, and the Decree N°2021-390 includes the same provision regarding the media being requisitioned as the first state of health emergency (see article 4 of said decree, 5).

The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 According to the US Department of State's 2020 report (2), 
''In accordance with the constitution, the law restricts individuals’ ability to criticize the government publicly. The government arrested journalists and activists who publicly denounced the misbehavior of public figures. The government often used unrelated charges to prosecute these journalists and activists. Most government actions to restrict freedom of expression occurred within the context of the national response to Covid-19, with journalists arrested or harassed for reporting failures of government officials to combat the disease effectively.''  

Apart from the de-jure limitations, in Madagascar the authorities have banned radio phone-in programmes in which listeners could express their views about the pandemic and the way the government is dealing with it:
''Amnesty International calls on the authorities to stop using the measures to address Covid-19 as a pretext to sanction media outlets, opposition figures or anyone critical of the government's actions.'' (1)

Another report (5) accused Madagascan government on an act of sabotage that has silenced an opposition TV channel and to guarantee journalistic freedom:
''Publishing director and journalist at the Ny Valosoa newspaper Arphine Helisoa was arrested and put in pre-trial detention on 4 April after she was accused of criticizing the president's handling of the national response to Covid-19 in an article. She is still in detention in Antanimora prison in the country's capital Antananarivo. She was charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina.''

The Madagascy authorities announced in October 2020 that all radio programs could resume their live call-in programs.''(2). However, no evidence was found on whether authorities stopped these practices after the state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020. 

The state of health emergency was reintroduced on 3 April 2021 and is in place at least until 28 June 2021. Under the state of health emergency, the Ministry of Communication and Culture is given extraordinary poewrs to control information regarding the pandemic. (2) 

On 22 April 2021, Malagasy authorities issued an interministerial decision that suspended the broadcasting of nine radio and audiovisual programs. The programs were suspended under the state of emergency, on the grounds that they were ''likely to disturb public order and security and harm national unity " (3, 4).

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 ...''health authorities have continued to use Covid-Organics, a herbal product made with Artemisia annua and launched on 20 April by the President, as a cure and prevention for the virus and is being distributed in schools and communities across the country. On 3 May 2020, WHO published a press release welcoming innovations around the world, including traditional medicines, as part of the search for potential treatments for Covid-19, and warning about the risks of using products that have not been robustly investigated. The document specifically highlights that the use of medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua as treatment for Covid-19 should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects. The Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Kwesi Quartey, in a tweet published on 13 May 2020 informed that the Madagascar's Health Ministry had agreed to collaborate with the Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) to investigate the remedy.'' ((1), August 2020). 

'The government has been distributing for free a so-called cure for the coronavirus, going against WHO guidlines.

''On 20 April 2020, President Andry Rajoelina himself launched Covid-Organics (CVO), an “improved traditional remedy with curative and preventive properties” against the coronavirus, as he described it.
Officially developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), the remedy is an infusion derived from artemisia and other plants which remain secret. It comes in the form of a liquid or infusion, with a defined dosage....The remedy’s discovery has also pushed authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.'' (5) 

When the Madagascan president ended the state of emergency on 18 October 2020, he mentioned that the country had 96% recovery rate, and partly attributed it to the efficacy of measures taken like the distribution of more than seven million doses of Covid-Organics distributed free of charge throughout the island. (2)  

Also, the President Andry Rajoelina was initially strongly against Covid-19 vaccines and instead supported and promoted Covid-Organics as a cure. The President changed course regarding the vaccinations, and joined the WHO-led COVAX programme in April 2021. This decision however will not affect the ongoing distribution of Covid-Organics ( 3,4).

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 150 soldiers were sent by the Madagascy government to Toamasina in May 2020, to help with law and order and the enforcement of the coronavirus measures - mask wearing and social distancing.
The state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020 and reintroduced on 3 April 2021. No evidence if the military continued being involved in enforcing Covid-19 measures after Q3 of 2020. The national police is otherwise responsible for law and order in urban areas: 

''National police, under the authority of the Ministry of Public Security, are responsible for maintaining law and order in urban areas. The gendarmerie and military report to the Ministry of National Defense. The gendarmerie is responsible for maintaining law and order in rural areas at the village level, protecting government facilities, and operating a maritime police contingent. The military is also active in rural areas, particularly in maintaining order in areas affected by cattle rustling and banditry. Civilian authorities at times did not maintain effective control over the security forces. Members of the security forces committed numerous abuses.'' (1)
