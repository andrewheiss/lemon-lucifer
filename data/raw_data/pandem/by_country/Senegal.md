## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The Senegalese President Macky Sall declared on 23 March 2020 a state of emergency (3, 4) in accordance with article 69 of the Constitution (1) and Law 69-29 of 29 April 1969 (2). 

After the state of emergency was lifted on 30 June 2020, the Senegalese government took various measures such as the mandatory wearing of face masks, based on the Constitution and the powers related to the minister of Interior (see 5, 6). 

On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of 29 April 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. (see 8, 9). 
The parliament enacted amendments to law no.69-29 of 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. As a result, in 2021, the same legal instrument is in place, as amended, but emlaw is now most accurately coded “2“. The ''state of health disaster'' was initially declared on 5 January 2021 accompanied by a night time curfew in two regions (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies) (7, 8, 9, 10). 

Senegal lifted the state of health disaster on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures (13).

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

 According to article 69 of the Constitution: ''...The decree proclaiming a state of siege or the state of urgency ceases to be in force after twelve days, unless the National Assembly, referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic, has authorized the continuation of it.'' 

After the amendment of the law no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis in January 2021, the head of state can decree a curfew without having previously established a state of emergency, or to go through the National Assembly to prolong it. The Parliament however authorized the government through by approving this law, therefore delegating extra powers to the President.

*Comments*:
 In Senegal, the National Assembly voted on 1 April 2020 the bill empowering the President of the Republic to "take, by ordinances, measures within the domain of the law to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic". 
The President had said on 23 March 2020 when he declared a state of emergency: "I will refer to the National Assembly a bill empowering the President of the Republic to take, for a period of three months, measures within the domain of the law".

''Senegalese deputies on 11 January 2021 adopted a law authorizing the President of the Republic to establish a curfew without declaring a state of emergency and without having to submit its decision to the National Assembly, a procedure considered too cumbersome (admitted also by the government itself) in the event of a health crisis or natural disaster. 
The new text aims to "cope more quickly with health crises and natural disasters" by "allowing" the administrative authorities to have the means of rapid intervention ", according to the head of the communication service of the presidency , Seydou Guèye.
The president will henceforth be able to decree a curfew or restrictions on movement without declaring a state of emergency or a state of siege. Depending on the circumstances, he may also delegate these powers to the Minister of the Interior, to regional governors or to departmental prefects.'' (5)

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The law (Article 69 Constitution) gives the right to the President to rule by decree in state of emergency, and the parliament approved a bill that gives the President the ability to "take, by ordinances, measures within the domain of the law to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic".Also, there have been guidlines on MPs to avoid physical contact and travel, but no other disruptions in the functioning of the Parliament.
The state of emergency ended on 30 June 2020. 

On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of April 29, 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. 
The parliament enacted amendments to loi no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. The ''state of health disaster'' was initially declared on 5 January 2021 on two regions, where a night-time curfew was also announced (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies). 

Senegal lifted the state of emergency on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 The state of emergency and curfew were nationwide during Q2 2020. The existing measures after the lifting of the state of emergency, up until January 2021, included a mandatory wearing of mask in public places and transport, and land and sea borders to  remain closed, as will places hosting closed-door leisure activities. 

The state of health disaster, introduced in 5 January 2021 - in place until 19 March 2021, was imposed on the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies. The measures in place after March 2021 applied nationwide.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

However, ''After several years of discussion, a new press code was adopted 2017 but the required implementation decrees have yet to be signed. Two bills were nonetheless submitted to the cabinet in early 2021. The new code disappointed journalists because it failed to decriminalise press offences and because it provides for the confiscation of equipment and material and even the closure of media outlets for threats to state security. Press freedom violations, some of them by the security forces, were registered in 2020. Certain stories with a religious link can still be taboo. The headquarters of the newspaper Les Echos were ransacked after it reported that a Muslim religious leader had caught Covid-19.'' 

Also, in March 2021, during  the protests that emerged when opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, a leading rival to President Macky Sall, was arrested and accused of rape, Senegal experienced an internet and social media shutdown: 
"Network data from the NetBlocks Internet Observatory confirm the disruption of social media and messaging apps in Senegal as of 5 March 2021. Metrics show that Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and some Telegram servers were restricted on leading cellular network operator Orange/Sonatel as of early morning Friday. Affected services have subsequently been restored from 7:30 a.m. UTC," reads a statement by NetBlocks.''

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on 30 June 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.''

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Senegal authorities have been using hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients since March 2020. The government has continued using the drug as of July 2020. It is unclear whether it is still being used by May 2021. We code as 0 for quarters that we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

''Regarding the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the official said the convincing results of the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were confirmed.
Professor Moussa Seydi, head of the infectious diseases department at Fann hospital, said this combination will be continued in Senegal.
“Currently, the analysis of our data collected from 838 patients. The results that we have obtained on the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have confirmed the efficiency of this combination,”'' (1)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 President Sall ''ordered the defense and security forces to stand ready for the immediate and strict execution of the measures enacted'''. 
''Police and gendarmes are responsible for maintaining law and order. The army shares that responsibility in exceptional cases, such as during a state of emergency. Senegal was under a state of emergency from 23 March to 30 June 2020. The National Police are part of the Ministry of the Interior and operate in major cities. The Gendarmerie is part of the Ministry of Defense and primarily operates outside major cities. The army also reports to the Ministry of Defense. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over the security forces.''
