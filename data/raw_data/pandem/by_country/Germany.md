## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 in 2020 and Q1 in 2021, the emergency measures taken toward Covid-19 were primarily done by the German states, and the federal government acts as a coordinating unit. The German constitution includes a state of emergency-clause, but this has not been activated (different types of states of emergency has however been enacted at the state level). The main emergency measures have been taken under the Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which is a federal law, but the adoption of the measures is taken by the states under this Law, not the federal government. It is worth noting that the federal government has taken several measures, not least in subsequently amending the Infection Protection Act and also passing financial aid packages. The Infection Protection Act saw larger amendments in March 2020 and May 2020  to adjust to the situation of Covid-19, and yet another amendment in November 2020. The November amendment has caused debate in Germany as some (predominantly right wing) groups deem it too far reaching. Note also that a host of amenmdents and Covid-19 related legislation has been enacted in Germany during this time, creating a highly complex juridical context. However, in terms of how the legal instrument works it keeps the setup of the states implementing the measures that the amendment enables. The primary emergency response thus exists at the state level, and this is therefore coded as 6 for Q2-Q4 in 2020 and Q1 in 2021. 
On 2021-04-21, however, German parliament enacted a new amendment of the Infection Protection Act that mandates the states to impose a coherent set of restrictions if the number of Covid-19 cases exceed 100 in a 7-day period. These restrictions include curfews, restrictions on gatherings and restrictions on business. Thus, while state’s still have the possibility to extend further measures under such circumstances, there is a nationally determined baseline of restrictions that is applied when cases reaches a certain point. Given that the restrictions included in this new amendment are many of the most central ones, as of this point Germant is coded as having a national emergency response, and coded as 4 since this is no state of emergency but a new amendment to existing legislation.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. Thus, for Q2 2021, the national-level legal instrument was the Infection Protection Act.

The time limit for the restrictions taken under this amendment depends on how quickly the extent of infections drop in each state (and some will not have them imposed if infection rates are low), but the time limit for the amendment being in effect is 2021-06-30. Since there is a general time limit on the measures, this is coded as 1.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There is no state of emergency, and no other sort of state of exception that has changed the Bundestags role. The German Parliament continues to work, however with fewer members present and a restricted programme. The Bundestag have also passed and amended federal laws during the pandemic in order to aid the states and population. Especially, the parliament passed the amendment that created the national-level emergency response now in place. Thus, no evidence has been found that the parliaments law-making role has been limited. Note however that there has been critique that parliament has been too passive during the pandemic, and let the government and the federal states coordinate most measures without particular involvement from parliament (aside from amending laws etc., which the parliament must do). However, as far as have been found here, this has not been due to the law-making role having been limited, but rather that the parliament has chosen to be relatively passive. At the state-level, also, there seem to have been less oversight and participation from the parliaments than usual, but this is not accounted for here. Thus, there’s no evidence found that the law-making role of the national parliament has been limited in any way, and thus coded 0 for all periods.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The federal government have coordinated a lot of the emergency response and implemented a set of measures during the pandemic that have resulted in a fairly similar response across most states. However, some states such as Bavaria and Thuringia have taken more far reaching responses at times, and there are also other states in which differing emergency measures have been imposed. While there thus are some states that do differ a lot from most others, the measures taken have not been so different across the states that it results complete or almost complete sub-national variation during any of the periods, and this is therefore coded as 2. While the amendment on 2021-04-21 created more homogeneity in the measures as some baseline of restrictions (onto which states can infer more restrictions) is applied to all areas which meets a threshold of infection rates, not all district have met this threshold and some drop below it over time. Thus, there continues to be sub-national variation in Germany, and this is coded 2 for all periods.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 Neither the EU agency for fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch or Amnesty international has reported any incidents of violations of non-derogable rights, and no other indication has been found that that has occurred in Germany's Covid-19 response. This is therefore coded as 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 Neither Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International nor EU agency for fundamental rights have reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures. Germany has seen many protests toward Covid-19 restrictions, many of which have turned violent. Police have responded to the violence, arresting individuals and using measures such as water cannons and pepper spray. However, none of this has been reported as excessive force or enforcing the restrictions violently. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
