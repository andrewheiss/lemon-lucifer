## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1), and particularly article 44(1), has been the legal instrument the Greek government has been using to legislate on Covid-19 related issues throughout all quarters of 2020 and 2021. 
Art.44(1) gives extra powers to the executive in emergency situations (other than war). This legal instrument gives the executive the power for ''fast-track'' law-making, through the adoption of ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts are submitted to the Parliament for approval after their issuance, and are then accompanied by ''(Common) Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts Legislative Content. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 was passed by the greek government - and then approved by the Parliament - in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 6). The first nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March 2020 (7). The second lockdown was introduced in 7 November 2020, with an initial end date on 30 November 2020 (8). 
Consecutive Acts of Legislative Content and (Common) Ministerial Decisions have been issued during the pandemic (2, 3, 4, 5). See a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 9.

Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

## Beginning of emergency response (*emstart*) 

*Question*: When did the government first adopt this legal instrument in response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This refers to the date that the legal instrument defined in emlaw was first used to enact a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  If the exact date is unknown, the first day of the month is given.  If unknown, leave blank.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2020-02-25

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2020-02-25

 

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution does not require an official invocation of Article 44. This legal instrument is therefore considered to have started being implemented from the date of the first package of measures, i.e. the date when the legal instrument was ''triggered''. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' - with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 - was passed by the greek government and then approved by the Parliament in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 2). The strictest measure, i.e. the first nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March 2020 (3) and lifted on 3 May 2020. The second lockdown was introduced in 7 November 2020 (4) and lifted on 14 May 2021. 
Consecutive Acts of Legislative Content and (Common) Ministerial Decisions have been issued during the pandemic. The government continues to use this legal instrument as of June 2021 (5 - 9).

*Comments*:
 The greek government has been using art 44(1) of the Constitution as a legal instrument to pass Covid-19 legislation throughout the pandemic - from February 2020 up to June 2021. Even after the lifting of the second lockdown in 14 May 2021, the government continues to use the same legal instrument to implement other Covid-19 measures, such as the number of people allowed in public gatherings, facemasks, etc. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' - with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 - was passed by the greek government and then approved by the Parliament in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 2).

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No end date for some or all provisions. 
 1. Yes.

*Comments*:
 The legal instrument used to deal with the pandemic- art. 44(1) of the Constitution - does not require an official invocation, and there are no provisions in the Constitution for how long it should be used. The government has not clarified for how long it intends to legislate using art 44(1). 

Nevertheless, each of the provisions taken to combat Covid-19 had an end date (see a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 1). 
The strictest measure, i.e. the nationwide lockdown, was initially declared on 23 March 2020 to last until 6 April 2020 (2), and was eventually lifted on 4 May 2020. The second nationwide lockdown started on 7 November 2020 with a first end date on 30 November 2020 (3). The lockdown was being continuously extended until it was fully lifted on 14 May 2021. 
In Q3 of 2020 no lockdown was in place, but all other measures, i.e. regulations on public gatherings or a night-time curfew, had a limit date (see also 5).

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

## Legislature approval (*emlegapp*) 

*Question*: Did the legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the enhanced powers as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 The Legislative Acts containing measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic have been approved by the Parliament after their issuance. The lockdown decision was part of a group of measures that were approved with a Legislative Act, but its specific content and details were issued through a Ministerial Decision (KYΑ Δ1 α/Γ.Π οικ 20036/2020 - ΦΕΚ 986/Β/22-3-2020) (4), which technically does not need (nor was granted) parliamentary approval, but it requires authorization by being published on the Government Gazette. The same procedure applied to all other measures and lockdown decisions: they were issued as Ministerial Decisions but legally referred to the initial Covid-19 Legislative Acts.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The executive has the power to make fast-track laws and decisions on Covid-19 related matters (using art. 44 of Constitution), but not to rule by decree, as these fast-track laws need parliamentary approval on a later stage.
 During March-May 2020, the Legislature continued working as normal, but with fewer sessions and fewer MPs present. The parliamentary oversight was and has been in place and functioning. 
''Plenary: Reduced quorum, Committee: Limited to urgent matters, Voting mechanism: Ballot paper, Staff: Non-essential are working remotely.
Used procedure of 'organized debate'. Committees can conduct meetings physically or remotely.'' (1, 2)
Also, the Greek Parliament decided to only vote on one draft bill per week, with priority given to bills related to the management of the coronavirus outbreak. (3)

In October - November 2020, the government implemented a few stricter measures in the Parliament building (see 8, 9), but these did not affect parliamentary oversight or legislative work.

Nevertheless, the government has been criticized  of eroding parliamentary scrutiny in the midst of the pandemic (6), mainly for having launched several non-Covid-19 related laws, many of which quite important (environmental bills, education), with fast-track processes (using the same legal instrument - art 44 - that is being used to deal with the pandemic).

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 The measures taken in Q2 of 2020, particularly the lockdown but also the closing of all non-essential services, applied countrywide. A few different extra measures were introduced locally in relation to Covid-19 cases' distribution (see 1, 2).
In Q3 of 2020, when the previous measures were lifted, the government started taking gradually local measures to deal with a new surge of Covid-19 cases in places such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands. These measures gradually included the closing of bars and restaurants in those infected areas and a 50-person limit for public gatherings. In addition, some nationwide measures were also introduced, like the mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces (see 4, 5).
In Q4 of 2020, the government started by increasing local Covid-19 measures in highly infected areas (such as Thessaloniki and Athens at first), but in November 2020 ended up reimposing a nationwide lockdown and a night-time curfew from 09:00pm to 5am (see 6, 7, 8, 9). 
During Q1 of 2021, some areas with increased Covid-19 cases were put under stricter local restrictions, such as a different night time curfew (10). During Q2 of 2021, the measures were more or less uniform throughout the country (11).

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 The Greek government, alongside the nationwide lockdown it imposed to deal with the pandemic in March 2020, it also imposed movement restrictions of asylum-seekers in refugee camps in the Aegean islands in April 2020 and extended it continuously, without any virological basis, i.e. without any Covid-19 case having been found (2). The first Covid-19 case in Moria camp in Lesvos was reported in early September 2020. (7) 

During Q2 of 2020, after the lifting of the the nationwide lockdown on 4 May 2020, the government announced that the island camps will continue to be closed until May 2020 and then June 2020 without offering an explanation on its decision. (1, 4, 5, 6).

During Q3 of 2020, after the first Covid-19 case was found in Moria in September 2020 (7) , the Greek authorities extended the lockdown of all structures hosting refugees and migrants until 15 September 2020. (8)

In Q4 of 2020, many refugee camps continued being under lockdown, but this time because Covid-19 cases were found. Some other camps however stopped being under quarantine after Covid-19 was under control (e.g. Malakasa camp on 12 October 2020), while other like the VIAL camp in Chios, is in quarantine due to coronavirus infections since 14 October 2020, last extended through 4 November 2020 (see 9, 10). 

Nevertheless, the greek government decided in November 2020 to continue controlling movement in all camps, and the police controls entry and exit: ''The Greek Government announced the control of movement until further notice in almost all the camps.'' (11).

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 The Greek government is considered to have violated Article 7 of ICCPR (see 1, 8) due to various documented cases of refoulement of asylum seekers, often leaving them adrift off shore where they face life threatening conditions or sending them back home where they face abuse (see 1 - 5). 
''Greek officials have made headlines by intercepting and turning back boats filled with asylum-seekers before those boats can land on Greek soil. Although Greek officials have employed such practices for several years, experts have suggested that “Greece’s behavior during the pandemic has been far more systematic and coordinated.” The New York Times has reported that asylum-seekers have been “left to drift in their own boats after Greek officials disabled their engines” and reports throughout the summer and fall (2020) have documented Greek Coast Guard officials forcing asylum-seekers who arrive on Greek soil onto unpropelled life rafts, towing them out of Greek waters, and cutting them loose to drift. Human Rights Watch notes that Greek law enforcement officers have also summarily returned asylum-seekers at the land border with Turkey.'' (1). 

The government intensified its refoulement efforts under Covid-19, during a period when it had also suspended asylum processes (6, 7; see also 1)

"“They’ve seized the moment,” Professor Crépeau said of the Greeks. “The coronavirus has provided a window of opportunity to close national borders to whoever they’ve wanted.“” (3). 

These developments have violated the freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (ICCPR Article 7), on the basis that non-refoulement of asulym seekers is now considered as a non-derogable right under ICCPR Article 7: 

“The Human Rights Committee has also interpreted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to encompass the principle of non-refoulement. Article 7 of the ICCPR affirms that “[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” As one legal commentator points out, the “prohibition on refoulement is inferred as a component of the absolute prohibition of torture as well as inhuman and degrading treatment.” (8; 1).

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

Throughout the pandemic, journalists had to get the government’s permission before reporting in hospitals on Covid-19 issues, and the health ministry banned medical staff from talking to the media.(6)

In addition, when the Greek government allocated a controversial 20-million-euro public information campaign about the virus, investigative media and outlets critical of the government received less than 1 percent of the total sum, compared to pro-government outlets, and one particularly anti-government outlet was excluded entirely from the funding (1, 6).

Ever since, the Greek government has ''sought, directly or indirectly, to control the flow of information closely as part of its efforts to deal with both the coronavirus pandemic and the refugee crisis.'' (6). 

Throughout the pandemic, journalists had to get the government’s permission before reporting in hospitals on Covid-19 issues, and the health ministry banned medical staff from talking to the media.(6) 

Authorities in Greece, after a Greek Ministry of Health's decision on 23 March 2020, decided to deny access to health editors during briefings on Covid-19: 
''As of 23 March 2020, the Greek Ministry of Health, citing public health safety reasons, has decided to close its doors to health editors on a daily basis from Sotiris Tsiodras' spokesman and Deputy Ministers of Civil Protection and Health. In addition, the journalists were informed that they will have the opportunity to ask one - and only one, although there are three speakers -  question per week, which should be submitted in writing to the Press Office, which will read it on "air", without it ability to clarify or apply pressure in order to respond effectively.'' (1,2,3)

Also, opposition media outlets in July 2020 were excluded from a government support package in Greece: 
''Greek newspaper Documento was excluded from a €20 million advertising revenue support package organised by the government in apparent retaliation for its critical coverage and investigative reports in the Prime Minister and his inner circle. When asked why Documento had not been received funding like every other major media outlet in the country, the government spokesman replied that the government did not give funding to outlets threat spread “fake news”. (1,4,5). 

Another incident occurred on 20 March 2021. ''Kostas Vaxevanis, publisher of the Athens-based newspaper Documento, tweeted that an arrest warrant had been issued against him. His newspaper had published the full text of a lawsuit lodged against him personally by 22 police officers, with their names on its front page. The policemen were under investigation for the torture of a young activist. Earlier, on 9 March 2021, clashes had erupted between the police and some of the 5,000 protesters who had gathered in the middle-class Athens suburb of Nea Smyrni to demonstrate against police brutality while enforcing Covid-19 quarantine measures. The protest was prompted by a recent event in the neighbourhood, when a rapid response squad out on Covid-curfew patrol harassed a family and then attacked a young man who stepped in to argue in their defence.''

''As the journalist was documenting the arrest of protesters, he was approached by traffic police officers, and despite the fact that he was wearing a full gas mask, police tried to fine him €300 under Covid-19 regulations for not wearing a surgical mask. The officers then brought him to the headquarters of the Traffic Police where Rigopoulos claims they addressed him in a threatening and abusive manner in an attempt to provoke him. He later reported that one officer pushed him forcefully into a chair and shouted aggressively in his face. Rigopoulos added that officers repeatedly refused to acknowledge his journalistic ID and took his national ID off him for about half an hour.'' (1-4). 

Since December 2020 up to May 2021, there have been many incidents of police violence against journalists covering protests, but these were unrelated to Covid-19 coverage. (7)

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The greek government's information about Covid-19 related matters are in agreement with WHO guidεlines. However, several governmnet agents - including the PM himselft - have not been vocal enough on the issue of whether the holy communion can spread Covid-19 (1). 

''Conservative government officials have chiefly blamed overcrowding in bars and restaurants and seem loath to point the finger at the church, even though the disease has clearly spread through the ranks of the clergy in recent weeks.'' (2) 
''Also, state epidemiologists in Greece have differing opinions on the question of holy communion: Eleni Yiamarellou, a government health adviser, has publicly and repeatedly declared since March 2020 up to May 2021 that the practice poses no health risk to believers.'' (2) 
Further, two prominent MPs from the ruling party participated in the holy communion practice, in March 2020 and September 2020, with one of them stating it that her faith is stronger than the virus (3, 4). 

Although the greek PM has not defended these practices and incidents, he has nevertheless avoided taking a clear stance against the Orthodox church, or making his position fully clear on the holy communion issue.

*Comments*:
 The government used police forces to enforce social distancing measures. The police resorted in excess use of violence, sending many people to the hospital and arresting quite a few individuals during Q2 of 2020 (1).

In November 2020, police also resorted in violence, tear gas at peaceful gatherings and arrests (see 5, 6, 7).

Between December 2020 and April 2021, there have been numerous cases of police violence and brutality against individuals and peaceful protesters in the pretext of Covid-19 regulations' enforcement. 
Police violence and citizens' reactions against it peaked after the police attacked peaceful citizens at a square in an Athens suburb during lockdown checks leading to a rally protesting police violence on 7 March 2021 (see 10-15) 

''Reports surfaced about police excessive use of force and illtreatment against people who gathered in Athens and Thessaloniki. Reported misuse of chemical irritants by police, beatings, verbal abuse and threats by riot police as well as police officers belonging to the DRASIS force. According to witnesses, the police transferred people in police station without measures taken to protect them from Covid-19 infection, not allowed to contact their lawyers for several hours and did not receive medical assistance for their injuries.''

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 The greek police is responsible for enforcing the lockdown measures. In addition, the Municipal Police, the Hellenic Coast Guard in their respective authority areas, and the National Transparency Authority participate in the enforcement efforts wherever necessary. The military has been enrolled in somce cases to help out with the vaccination processes.
