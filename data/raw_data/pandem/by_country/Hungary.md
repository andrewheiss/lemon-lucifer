## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 

 

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: Decree 282/2020 from 17 June lifted the state of danger and terminated the Coronavirus Protection Act (Act XII of 2020 on the containment of coronavirus) from 30 March 2020. Was replaced by the state of epidemiological preparedness (Decree 283/2020) without an end date. The "LAW ON TRANSITIONAL RULES AND HEALTH PREPAREDNESS RELATED TO THE CESSATION OF THE STATE OF DANGER " from 17 June 2020 " introduces measures related to the revocation of the "state of danger" in Hungary. However, the law expands the powers of the government during another exceptional state, by authorizing the government to issue wide-ranging decrees without parliamentary approval during a “state of medical crisis.” During such a state, the law authorizes the government to suspend existing laws and restrict fundamental rights such as freedom of movement and assembly. The government may declare a “state of medical crisis” unilaterally, based on the recommendation of a government-appointed medical officer; the “state of medical crisis” can last up to six months and may be renewed by government decree. According to critics, the law gives the government expansive leeway to rule with minimal judicial and parliamentary scrutiny for an indefinite period." (1, ICNL) Note that the "state of medical crisis" has not been declared at the time of coding.

Q3 2020:  a state of epidemiological preparedness  was initially declared until 18 December 2020 and was extended until 18 June 2021, which has not ended at the time of coding.

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: state of danger has not ended at the time of coding. Although the second state of danger ended on 8 February 2021, a third state of danger was declared from 8 February 2021 and was extended until 22 May 2021, and further until September 2021. Since the legal instrument has been the same throughout the period, emend is left blank.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

According to the Fundamental Law (52 (2)), " In a state of danger, the Government may adopt decrees by means of which it may, as
provided for by a cardinal Act, suspend the application of certain Acts, derogate from the provisions of Acts and take other extraordinary measures." (1) Coded as 3 due to vague formulations.

It also  "authorized the Government to extend until the end of the state of danger the force of future, not-yet-adopted special decrees" (Hungarian Helsinki Committee, 1).A third state of danger was extended by parliament on 22 February 2021  and then on 22 May 2021 (Act I of 2021). According to the Fundamental Law (52 (2)), " In a state of danger, the Government may adopt decrees by means of which it may, asprovided for by a cardinal Act, suspend the application of certain Acts, derogate from the provisions of Acts and take other extraordinary measures.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 The Hungarian Helsinki Committee argues that the measures used to expel Iranian students for violating the quarantine are discriminatory, but I have not found further confirmation of this in other sources. The authorities also suspended the admissions of refugees into the transit zone due to covid-19 concerns (most migrants coming from or transiting through Iran), although Human Rights Watch argues that most of them had been at the other side of the border for more than a year. Coded as 0 since the measures apply to people outside the country. Additional note: Hungarian parliament also passed a law prohibiting transgender or intersex people to change their gender, but this is not part of emergency measures (1). No new information found in July-September, October-December.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 No measures violating non-derogable rights found. Note that according to OSCE report, "fake news" legislature in countries that implemented such laws (including Hungary) (see melim) can be problematic since "there may well be a legitimate concern about the deliberate and malicious spread of disinformation, such criminal provisions are unlikely to comply with the principle of specificity of criminal law enshrined in Article 15 of the ICCPR and Article 7 of the ECHR due to the inherent vagueness and ambiguity of the term “false information”.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

Q4 2020, Q1 2020, Q2 2020: Same measures as during March-June (Section 337 of the Criminal Code) where misinformation is vaguely defined as when a person "states or disseminates any untrue fact or any misrepresented true fact that is capable of hindering or preventing the efficiency of protection."

## Media limitations end (*melimend*) 

*Question*: When do the de-jure limits on media freedom end?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Provide the exact date the emergency measures with de-jure limitations on media freedoms (*medialimits*) are set to expire. If the exact date is unknown, give the final day of the month.

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: For the duration of the state of emergency that was lifted on 17 June 2020. The law on misinformation (see melim) was added to the Penal Code and was declared not unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court, meaning that it would apply if a state of emergency is declared again. It does not apply during the state of epidemiological preparedness, therefore melimend is same as emend.

Q3 2020: no measures limiting media freedom found.

Q4 2020: The measures applied until the latest extension of the state of danger in this period, calculated as 8 February 2021 (90 days after 11 November 2020).

Q1 2021: The state of danger was extended by the parliament until 22 May 2021.

Q2 2021: The state of danger was extended by the parliament until 15 days after the start of the autumn parliamentary session. According to the parliament website, the autumn session starts on 1 September, so melimend is coded the same as emlimitdate (15 September 2021)

Moreover, "journalists could hardly find sources in the health care system or education system who were willing to talk. There is a definite fear among ordinary people from the consequences of leaking." (1)

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

 Daily press conferences are organized by Operational Group (OG) for Protection against the Coronavirus Epidemic where questions are pre-selected, certain outlets are neglected and sensitive topics avoided. The time it takes for public bodies to respond to requests (such as journalists' questions) was increased from 30 to 60 days.  In Q4 2020, press conferences were being held without physical presence of journalists. In Q1 2021, IPI and Human Rights Watch reported that journalists were prevented from interviewing medical professionals on Covid-19. Meinf is therefore coded as 2 in all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses).

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

Q3 2020: No information on military involvement in the execution of confinement measures found.

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: The military has been involved in monitoring curfew compliance and other tasks (authorized by Government Decree 484/2020). Since the decree is in place at the time of coding and I found no indication military's involvment has ended, milinv is coded as 1 in these periods.
