## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Malaysia has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 150), but this has not been used in 2020. Instead, the government has issued emergency measures and regulations under The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988, which puts the Minister of Health in charge and allows him/her to issue regulations. The most significant such regulation instituted under this law is the Movement Control Order, which was put in effect on March 20 and regulates freedom of movement, association, closing of public places, bussiness and borders, and the like. As these are new regulations enacted by the government through an existing legal instrument, this is coded as 4 [3]. 
The Movement Control Order was extended on August 28 and is set to end at December 31 [6]. This new legislation eases some of the restrictions, and is called a recovery movement control order, but still keeps a lot of the restrictions in place. In 2020, it was used to impose conditional movement control orders in several states on November 9 [5].

Malaysia's King Abdullah declared a state of emergency across the country on 12 January 2021 [4].

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

 The initial end date of the emergency legislation was 31 March. It has subsequently been extended several times. The last extension made in the Mar-Jun period was on June 10, extending it to August 31. On August 28, it was decided to extend it to December 31. This latter date is thus the end date for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods.

The state of emergency which was declared in January 2021, is set to last till 1 August 2021.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 3

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 4

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988 activates the powers of the National Security Council Act of 2016, which gives the government and Minister of Health vast powers to rule by decree on a number of issues (see part V of the National Security Council Act of 2016). However, the parliament has convened and held sessions during the pandemic, and the government has not suspended it (although their meeting was  initially postponed due to Covid-19). This is therefore coded as 3. The situation stays the same under the extended control movement order, where the government can rule by decree on several issues, but the parliament still convenes and hold their sessions. There is no indication found that this situation has changed over the periods, or that the legal basis that lets the government rule by decree under this time has been altered. This is therefore coded 3 for all three periods.

According to 2B of the Proclamation of Emergency in Malaysia's constitution, the government would be able to introduce laws without the approval of the Parliament. Furthermore the parliament was dissolved and will not reconvene until the end of the emergency in August 2021. On 16 June 2021, the King called for the parliament to be reconvened to debate the Covid-19 recovery plan. As the parliament has yet to reconvene, this variable has been coded as 4 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Many measures have been taken nationwide in Malaysia. However, consistently throughout the periods there has been regional measures such as curfews, limits of public gatherings and lockdowns along with those measures taken by national government. Thus there has been some regional variation in emergency measures, but also some conforming measures. This is therefore coded as 2 for all time periods.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 3

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 3

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and BBC report that the Malaysian government has detained migrants during Covid-19, including children, arguing that this was necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Law enforcement rounded up and arrested hundreds of migrants in Kuala Lumpur, and placed in detention camps. A Bangladeshi migrant who criticized these actions by the government on TV was also prosecuted for speaking up on the the issue. This is therefore coded as 3, major de facto discrimination. No evidence has been found that this practice has stopped, or that the situation has improved, and the more general discrimination toward migrants and refugees in Malaysia seem to be on-going.

There is evidence that the authorities have continued to detain migrants in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. This is therefore coded 3 across all the time periods.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 No violations of non-derogable rights have been found in or in relation to the government response to Covid-19.It could be worth noting that Rohingyan refugees were sentenced to "three strokes of the cane" for seeking regufe in Malaysia, a physical punishment that Human Rights Watch claim constitutes torture under international human rights law. However, this sentece was never executed and subsequently revoked, and the Malaysian authorities have thus not conducted any violations of non-derogable rights in this case. Furthermore, no evidence has been found of any other instance where such rights was violated during and in relation to the pandemic.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

 Under the state of emergency in 2021, the government issued "Emergency (Essential Powers) (No. 2) Ordinance 2021 " which "makes it a criminal offense to create, publish, or disseminate “fake news” relating to Covid-19 or the proclamation of emergency in the country, or to fail to take down such material upon the government’s request" (1). Coded as 2 due to vague formulations

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 While no reports have been found on journalists being arrested or media outlets shut down for their reporting on Covid-19, journalists have been arrested for their reporting on the governments response to it under Section 505 in the penal code (as well as other legislation) that bans statements that can cause "fear or alarm to the public". As this is vaguely formulated, it poses a de facto threat to media reporting on the nature of Covid-19 as well, and this is therefore coded as 1.

On 12 March 2021, the government issued an "anti-fake news" emergency ordinance. With this instrument, the government is able to "effectively ban any information about the pandemic or current state of emergency that is not its liking". With this, the government is able to choose the information about the pandemic and state of emergency that is released and not released to the public. This adds another layer to the de-facto limitations on reporting on the nature of Covid-19 [1,2,3].

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 The Malaysian authorities have arrested journalists under Section 505 of the penal code (as well as other legislation), which bans statements causing "fear or alarm to the public". While this vague formulation could be used to prosecute journalists on non-Covid-19 related news as well, there is no reports found of that happening, and the authorities seem to only use this legislation to place de facto limitations on reporting on Covid-19 related issues as of yet. This is therefore coded as 0.

On 12 March 2021, issued an "anti-fake news" emergency ordinance. With this instrument, the government is able to effectively ban any information  that is not its liking. The wording of the ordinance is not specific to the pandemic. The authorities would be able to use this to place de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid 19 related news. Hence I have coded this variable as 1 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 [1,2,3].

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

He reportedly stopped their taxi at a COVID-19 movement control order roadblock and, finding that they had no valid travel documents, took them forcibly to a hotel where he raped them.” (1)

While there are reports that Malaysia has arrested and jailed thousands of people for breaking curfews and other emergency measures, no reports have been found on police or other security forces having used violence when enforcing these measures in Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
