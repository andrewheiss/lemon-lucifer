## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita decreed a state of health emergency and a curfew (applied from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.) on 26 March 2020 (2 and 3). 
There are two legal provisions relating to the state of (health) emergency in Mali: the law 2017 055 of 6 November 2017 (3) on the state of emergency and state of siege, and the Constitution, articles 49 and 50 (1). However, the decree issued did not refer to any of these provisions (see 2, 3, 4). 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted. 

No information could be found on whether the state of health emergency continued in Mail after its initial declaration. The night-time curfew was lifted on 9 May 2020. Preventative measures were in place after that date, like social disctancing guidelines and the mandatory wearing of face masks (5, 6). 

On 18 August 2020, following a military coup, the President and Prime Minister resigned, and Mali has been without a president and without a government since 18 August 2020. The country is led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita. ''Mali parliamentary elections were held on 29 March 2020 (second round on 19 April 2020), after having been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on 2 May 2020. The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on 12 May 2020.'' (see 7-11). 
Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on 1 April 2020 that authorized the government to take Covid-19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from 1 April 2020 until May 2020 when the parliamentary elections would have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020. In fact, no evidence was found on the bill being adopted at all. 

Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, the Malian transition government declared a state of health emergency on 18 December 2020, to last initially for 10 days (until 28 December 2020). The state of emergency was declared on the national territory by Decree n ° 2020-0317 of 18 December 2020, and was based on law 2017 055 of 6 November 2017 on the state of emergency and state of siege (12). 

The government extended the state of health emergency on 23 December 2020 until 26 June 2021 (13, 14). ''In accordance with Law n ° 2017-055 of 6 November 2017 relating to the state of siege and the state of emergency, its extension beyond 10 days is authorized by law.''

*Comments*:
 In addition to the developments below, Mali is facing internal political turbulence, and the President and Prime Minister resigned on 18 August 2020 following a military coup:
''On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced his resignation, explaining that he had no other choice but to submit to the will of his army in revolt to prevent blood from being spilled.'' (1, 2, 3). 
'Mali parliamentary elections were held on 29 March 2020 (second round on 19 April 2020) despite the coronavirus situation, as they had been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on 2 May 2020. (4, 5). The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on 12 May 2020.

Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on 1 April 2020 that authorized the government to take Covid-19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from 1 April until May 2020 when the parliamentary elections will have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020, nor if it was adopted at all.

The second state of emergency of 18 December 2020 (extended until 26 June 2021) has not been approved by the Parliament, since Mali has not held new legislative elections (6).

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 The government can rule by ordinance in emergency circumstances, and without parliamentry approval: Constitution (1), Article 50 - ''When the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the nation,.... is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures commanded by these circumstances, after consultation with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the National Assembly and of the High Council of Territorial Units as well as the Constitutional Court. The National Assembly shall meet by right and shall not be dissolved during the exercise of these exceptional powers.''

On 18 August 2020 a military coup took place in Mali, leading to the resignation of the PM and President, and the dissolution of the National Assembly (see 4, 5, 6). Mali has been without a president and without a government since 18 August 2020. The country was being led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita (7). On 25 September 2020, retired colonel and former defence minister Bah Ndaw was sworn in as Mali’s interim president (11). On 15 April 2021, the transitional administration announced that legislative and presidential elections will be held on 27 February 2022 (12). 

Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, the Malian government declared a state of health emergency on 18 December 2020, to last initially for 10 days (until 28 December 2020). The government extended the state of health emergency on 23 December 2020 until 26 June 2021.

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 "The use of Chloroquine was validated on 1 April 2020 by the Ministry of Health", according to an official of the Covid-19 treatment center at the Hospital of Mali.'' (1) 

''In Mali , WHO representatives contacted by Studio Tamani refused to comment on this decision by the World Health Organization and on the existence of other possible treatments in place of chloroquine. However, the national coordinator of the risost against Covid-19 affirms that Malian experts have met to allow the country to adopt a position in the face of this situation. As a reminder, the use of Chloroquine was validated in Mali on 1 April 2020 by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.'' (2) 

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

*Comments*:
 There are several incidents with police violence against protesters, but these relate either to the political crisis facing Mali during July-August 2020 (see 4), or to isolated incidents unrelated to the emergency measures (see 1, 2)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 No reports on the military's involvement. Because of the state of emergency and the security situation in Mali however, the army is deployed in the borders but not related to Covid-19.
