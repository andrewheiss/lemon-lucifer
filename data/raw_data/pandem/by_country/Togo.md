## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The president of Togo declared a three-month nationwide "health emergency,"on 1 April 2020, and a six-month period of exceptional lawmaking authority under Article 86 (and 94) of the Constitution. (1)
Before the president's declaration, on 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of 1 April 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.

Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the Constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 5, 6), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly ssee link 6), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution.
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the Constitution looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 According to Article 94 of the Constitution (1), both the state of siege and the state of urgency are declared by the President of the Republic in [the] Council of Ministers, but require the authorization by the National Assembly for their extension beyond fifteen days. During the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency, the National Assembly may not be dissolved.

Article 86 also reads that the ''Government can, for the execution of its programs, demand of the National Assembly, the authorization to take by ordinances, during a limited time period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after the opinion of the Constitutional Court. They enter into force on their publication, but become lapsed if the bill of law of ratification is not deposited with the National Assembly before the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time period defined in the enabling law, these ordinances may only be modified by the law, in that which concerns their provisions which arise in the legislative domain.''

## Legislature approval (*emlegapp*) 

*Question*: Did the legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the enhanced powers as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Before the president's declaration of the state of emergency, on 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (1), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance, according to article 86 of the constitution.
The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.'' (4)

The definitive duration of each period should be decided by presidential decree, depending on how the pandemic evolves. The goal is to give some flexibility to measures taken in response to Covid-19; measures which, it should be noted, are taken at the council of ministers, based on the opinion of the constitutional court. 

Togo last extended the State of Health Emergency on 16 March 2021, to run through 16 September 2021. ''The decision was approved by the National Assembly after a request was submitted by PM Victoire Tomégah-Dogbé on 16 March 2021.''

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 On 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus, all the consequent measures taken, including the declaration of the state of emergency, had already been authorized by the National Assembly, and in addition as article 5 of the Law No. 2020-005 mentions, ''During the empowerment period, the Government shall communicate to the National Assembly, at its request, any measure taken or implemented in application of this law.'' The Law No. 2020-005 clearly lists all the domains and the specific policy areas that the Government may decide on.Art. 94 of the Constitution also clarifies that the the National Assembly may not be dissolved during the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency'.The National Assembly has also taken some social distancing measures.

The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.'' (5) 

The National Assembly also approved the last extension of the state of health emergency on 16 March 2021, until mid-September 2021 .

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 The state of emergency has been countrywide throughout since its introduction. During Q2 of 2020, there was also a nationwide curfew which was lifted in June 2020.
Since August 2020 there had been a few areas in Togo where the coronavirus measures differed: a lockdown and curfew was initially imposed in the towns of Sokodé, Tchamba and Adjengre, and subsequently in the prefectures concerned. 

These local lockdowns and curfew were maintained in Q1 of 2021: ''The northern Savanes region is under an indefinite lockdown. A 2000-0500 curfew is in place. Movement and travel restrictions are reportedly in effect in Sokode, Tchamba, and Adjengre.'' (8)

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

The US state report 2020 on human rights practices however, mentions: 
''On 11 April 2020, security personnel enforcing the Covid-19 state of emergency reportedly assaulted an elderly woman, Nyanuwoede Drafoe, living in Agbodrafo, an area approximately 20 miles from Lome. Her family members reported she was beaten for not respecting the curfew. Human rights organizations noted, however, the curfew was not in force in the area at that time and that the use of force was excessive and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. The human rights organizations referred the case to the CNDH, which began an investigation.''

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 There are reports of attempts at censoring journalists who investigate corruption cases, but explicit evidence of limitations on reporting on Covid-19 could not be found (1, 2, 3). 

According to RSF, ''The development of an investigative journalism culture is being held back by the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication, a media regulator whose lack of independence is clear from the way it harasses, prosecutes and imposes sanctions that have included suspending one newspaper after another, the latest being investigative journalist Ferdinand Mensah Ayité’s bi-weekly, L’Alternative.''

''Togo's supreme court administrative chamber decided on 9 March 2021 to confirm the four-month suspension that the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC) imposed a month ago on the newspaper L’Alternative. The HAAC ordered the suspension in response to a complaint by the minister of urbanism, housing and land reform, who was described as a “forger” by the newspaper because, it said, he used forged documents when administering the property of the family of a wealthy businessman who recently died.''

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Togo has been using Chloroquine in the Covid-19 treatment and in May 2020 the national coordination team for the Covid-19 response decided to keep using it despite WHO's position against it. (1,2). 

The drug continued being used by July 2020, i.e. after June 17th 2020 when WHO officially decided to discontinue its trials for the drug after showing no results in effectively treating the virus. 
''The Government of Togo administers chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against this pharmacologic treatment as there is no evidence that it lessens the duration or severity of Covid-19.'' (3) (4)
By October 2020, the government is still using chloroquine for treating Covid-19 patients. (5)

No evidence was found on whether chloroquine is still being used by June 2021. We code as 0 for quarters that we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

*Comments*:
 When President Faure Gnassingbé announced on 2 April 2020 a state of emergency and a curfew to go into immediate effect, the government deployed 5,000 soldiers who beat and assaulted civilians that same evening. Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. A video also emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten. The minister of security said an epileptic attack was the cause of death, but the family says he was tortured by security forces.'' (2, 3)

No more incidents were found after Q2 of 2020.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
