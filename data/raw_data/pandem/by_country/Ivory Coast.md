## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 President Alassane Ouattara announced on 23 March 2020 the establishment of a state of emergency to combat Covid-19 throughout the territory until 15 April 2020 (2, 3, 4) with the Decree n°2020‐351 du 23 mars 2020 (5, 6), according to Constitution articles 73, 101, 105 (1), and Law 59-231 of November 7, 1959 on the state of emergency. It was accompanied by strict measures like a night time curfew, closing of services, and a ban on “unauthorised” travel between the capital Abidjan and the interior. 

The state of emergency was being renewed during Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2020 (11).  

On 21 January 2021, on the proposal of the Covid-19 Watch Committee, the National Security Council, under the chairmanship of the Head of State, Alassane Ouattara, ''decided to establish a state of (health) emergency throughout the territory, from 21 January to 28 February 2021.'' (see 8, 9). The state of health emergency remains in effect until 30 June 2021 (10). 

However, it is a bit unclear whether and when the state of emergency was lifted. The Communique by the Council of Ministers on 09-30-2020 (7) mentions that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020''. It appears that the initial SOE from 2020 expired sometime in December 2020, but was reintroduced on 21 January 2021.

It is also unclear if there is a different legal regime under which the 2021 state of health emergency was adopted, since the Government Press Releases do not make a reference to any legal instrument. The law is vague in the Constitution and the law from 1959 on the state of emergency could not be located. It appears that the state of health emergency and state of emergency fall under the same instrument so we code this as a state of emergency throughout.

*Comments*:
 The Decree 2020-351 of 23 March 2020 (1) which declared a state of emergency, did not include a limit date, it only mentioned that this measure may be renewed if necessary. 
In some of the later Communiques by the Council of Ministers (see e.g. 2, 3), a limit date and extension fo the state of emergency is mentioned, but it hasn't been found for all. 
e.g. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 04-29-2020: ''The Council adopted a decree extending the state of emergency. This decree, which is part of the implementation of the national response plan to the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, extends the state of emergency declared on 23 March 2020 throughout the national territory, for a new period from 1 to 15 May 2020.'' 
In the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 09-30-2020 it is mentioned that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020, to continue the strategy of targeted screening and to protect patients, vulnerable and exposed people.'' (4). 

The state of health emergency, introduced on 21 January 2021, was initially declared until 28 February 2021 (see 5, 6). On 26 March 2021, the government extended the state of health emergency until 30 June 2021 (7, 8).

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 It looks like the Parliament does not need to authorize the state of emergency. The Constitution mentions:
Article 73 - Should the institutions of the Republic......be interrupted, the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures required by these circumstances, after consultation with the President of the National Assembly, President of the Senate and the President of the Constitutional Council. He informs the Nation thereof by message. Parliament meets without requiring to be convened. The end of the crisis is recognized by a message from the President of the Republic to the Nation.
And Article 74 - The President of the Republic initiates legislation concurrently with the members of Parliament. He ensures the promulgation of laws within thirty days after the law definitively adopted has been submitted to him. This period is shortened to five days in the event of an emergency.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 The law on the state of emergency could not be located, and the constitution is vague with regards to decree powers of the executive: 

''According to the Ivorian Constitution (3), ''when the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the execution of it international commitments are under grave and immediate threat, and that the regular operation of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by the circumstances, after officially consulting with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of [the National Assembly and the Senate], as well as the Constitutional Council.''
There does not appear to be any formal provision in Ivorian law regarding the functioning of the national legislature under emergency measures, nor does Ivorian law appear to provide for any sort of “emergency parliament” with devolved powers from the whole parliament to address crisis situations.''

''Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the National Assembly has limited all meetings to a maximum of 50 participants. The President of the National Assembly has requested that all members, staff, and visitors wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer available at washing stations installed at the building’s entrances and exits.'' 

The state of emergency gives powers to the Minister of the Interior. ''The latter can thus, by a simple decree, prohibit or regulate the movement of people and goods in the territorial district within which the state of emergency applies. He can reduce or prohibit, depending on the evolution of the situation, the movement of people or vehicles, at the times fixed by the decree. It can establish security protection zones where the stay of people is regulated. In the current case, this task falls to Minister Sidiki Diakité, Minister of Territorial Administration. It is therefore he who will pilot the progressive confinement procedure decreed by the President of the Republic.'' (4). 

Freedom House reports that the government used the state of emergency to change the electoral code by decree in the lead up to the 2020 elections. The opposition responded by boycotting these elections and the president won a third term with over 90% of the vote. (5) 

This seems to extend the decree powers well beyond Covid-19 issues.

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

During Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the state of health emergency was nationwide.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures?

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

 No evidence of police violence in enforcing the Covid-19 measures was found. 
However, in August 2020, there have been several days of violence where five people died but these were related to President Alassane Ouattara announcing that he will run a third presidential term. (1) 
Also, in the aftermath of the controversial presidential elections of October 31 2020, more than 50 people have been killed, and security forces are reported to have ''failed to adequately protect civilians and in at least one case used excessive force to disperse opposition-led protests, shooting dead at least two demonstrators and beating a man unconscious.''

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
