## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 DRC President HE Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo decreed by ordinance (n° 20/014) (2), on 24 March 2020 the state of health emergency to face the Covid-19 pandemic.
The state of health emergency was in accordance to the Constitution (1): articles 85, 86, 144, 145 (provisions on a state of emergency). The state of emergency was lifted on 22 July 2020. 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

After the lifting of the state of emergency, during Q3 and half of Q4 of 2020, there were social distancing measures in place and a mandatory wearing of face masks that applied nationwide, but these were taken under ''normal'' law-making powers (hence coding is 5). 

However, due a surge in Covid-19 cases, in 17 December 2020 President Félix Tshisekedi decreed an indefinite 2100-0500 curfew effective 18 December 2020 across the country. In addition to the curfew, barrier gestures (compulsory wearing of masks, physical distancing, regular hand washing and temperature measurement) were also ordered (7, 8).
The nationwide curfew was decreed with Arrete Ministeriel no25/032/2020 of 17 December 2020 (see 9 - 12), an was based on ''normal'' law-making powers and Constitution provisions that mainly originate from the Ministry of Interior. The references to the Constitution are vague, and there’s no direct reference to a specific legal instrument allowing the Ministry to declare these measures (hence coding is 5). 

On 14 April 2021, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi announced the easing of the curfew in some provinces, including the capital Kinshasa, and its complete lifting in others where the circulation of the virus was low. 
In other provinces including the city of Kinshasa, North - Kivu (east), Kongo Central (South - West), Lualaba (South - east), Haut - Katanga (South - east) and South - Kivu (east) where the epidemic curve is downward, the curfew in effect since December 2020 was pushed back to 10 pm until 4 am (13). 

A curfew is still in effect from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. in some provinces including Kinshasa as of June 2021 (14).

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 Article 85 of the Constitution provides the President with the power to proclaim "a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145". Article 144 establishes that a state of emergency will be in force for a period of thirty days. Extension of the state of emergency for 15 days at a time requires approval from the two chambers of the legislature. Article 119(2) reinforces this obligation. The legislature has the right to declare the state of emergency over at any time. Further, Article 145 requires that the Constitutional Court reviews all ordinances under a state of emergency to ensure they do not derogate from nonderogable rights [1]. 

Nevertheless, there has been some confusion over whether the President can declare a state of emergency without Congressional approval. In 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed that the President did not require authorization from Congress to declare a state of emergency. However, in 2019, the Constitutional Court reversed this decision, ruling that the President was required to obtain authorization from the two chambers before declaring a state of emergency. In 2020, after declaring the state of emergency, the President sought the opinion of the court, which reversed the 2019 ruling and declared that the President could choose whether to consult the legislature or not prior to making a declaration [2]. The ruling did not affect the requirement for legislative approval of extensions beyond the initial 30 days. 

Measures in place since the end of the state of emergency have been made by the Ministry of Interior [3] and Presidential proclamations [4]. These make no reference to a specific legal instrument and have not required legislative approval.

*Comments*:
 President Tshisikedi initially declared a state of emergency on 25 March 2020, without consulting the legislature. At that time, the legislature had suspended its sessions due to Covid-19. Afterward, legal scholars and members of the legislature questioned the president's authority to declare a state of emergency without consulting the Prime Minister or heads of the two chambers. In response to threats of impeachment, President Tshishikedi consulted the Constitutional Court, which overturned a prior 2019 decision by declaring that the president has the choice whether the consult with the legislature prior to adopting a state of emergency. Subsequently, the legislature approved several 15 day extensions to the state of emergency up until it ended on 22 July 2020. Therefore, we treat this as the legislature approving the measures, despite the initial 30-days allowed without its approval in March/April 2020. 

Measures in place since the end of the state of emergency have been made by the Ministry of Interior and Presidential proclamations. These make no reference to a specific legal instrument and have not required legislative approval.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The legislature suspended plenary sittings from 18 March to 5 April 2020 with reference to Covid-19, but it continued to function as a body, with committee meetings allowed under certain conditions [1]. The President of the National Assembly was also involved in the pandemic response during this period [2]. The legislature resumed sittings on 23 April, where it approved an extension of the state of emergency, and it renewed the state of emergency several times until it expired on 22 July 2020 [3]. Because the president declared the state of emergency without prior authorization from parliament and the measures were in place for 30 days without parliamentary approval, we code Q2 2020 as "2". During Q3 2020, extension of the state of emergency occurred through normal procedures and the legislature had the power, at any time, to end the state of emergency according to the constitution [4], thus we code this period as "1".  Since December 2020, the Ministry of Interior and the President have made several proclamations concerning restrictions related to Covid-19 without reference to a specific legal instrument. As such, we code Q4 of 2020 through Q2 of 2021 as "3" because vaguely formulated laws have allowed the executive to rule by decree.

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 The DRC announced a state of emergency on 25 March 2020, which was accompanied by: closure of the country's external borders (except freight); ban on gatherings; confinement of the commune of Gombe in the provincial capital Kinshasa (movement prohibited except provided with a badge issued by the authorities); obligation to wear a mask in the capital Kinshasa, even handcrafted. 
In the provinces, restrictive measures were also taken to limit the movement of people (excluding goods): quarantine of Lubumbashi, Goma, Beni, Butembo and Bukavu; curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in Lualaba province and the city of Lubumbashi; closures of air access (Tanganyika, Tshopo), port (South Kivu), or land (North Kivu / South Kivu, Ituri / Beni territory in North Kivu, Tshopo). 

After the lifting of the state of emergency, during Q3 and half of Q4 of 2020, there were social distancing measures in place and a mandatory wearing of face masks that applied nationwide. 

However, due a surge in Covid-19 cases, in 17 December 2020 President Félix Tshisekedi decreed an indefinite 2100-0500 curfew effective 18 December 2020 across the country. In addition to the curfew, barrier gestures (compulsory wearing of masks, physical distancing, regular hand washing and temperature measurement) were also ordered (4, 5).

On 14 April 2021, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi announced the easing of the curfew in some provinces, including the capital Kinshasa, and its complete lifting in others where the circulation of the virus was low. 
In other provinces including the city of Kinshasa, North - Kivu (east), Kongo Central (South - West), Lualaba (South - east), Haut - Katanga (South - east) and South - Kivu (east) where the epidemic curve is downward, the curfew in effect since December 2020 was pushed back to 10 pm until 4 am (6). 

A curfew is still in effect from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. in some provinces including Kinshasa as of June 2021 (7).

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include:

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

 The media landscape in DRC is characterized by a plethora of ''press freedom violations – including arrests, attacks, threats and ransacking or closures of media outlets''....''The environment for media personnel continues to be extremely hostile..'' (1) 

''In the DRC, caution can border on self-censorship. “Information on the diversion of public funds for combating the coronavirus has circulated in newsrooms,” says Tshivis Tshivauadi, secretary-general of Journalist in Danger, a Congolese press-freedom NGO  and RSF partner organization. “But journalists who dare to publish this information would risk prosecution.” Congolese media law, adopted in 1996, sets out prison terms, and even capital punishment, for some press crimes.'' (2) 

According to the HRW world report 2020 (3), ''Dozens of people who criticized government policies, including on social media, were intimidated and threatened, beaten, arrested, and in some cases prosecuted. Particularly targeted by authorities across the country, journalists faced threats and harassment, and some broadcast programs or outlets were shut down upon instructions from officials.'' (see also 4, 5). 

''Through 30 June 2020, the UNJHRO documented human rights abuses against at least 47 journalists and other media professionals. An HRW report in July 2020 stated that provincial-level officials were using the national state of emergency related to Covid-19 to restrict press freedoms and detain journalists and activists who criticized them or their policies.'' (4, 5). 

''Journalism continues to be a dangerous profession in the DRC. In Mongala province, Equateur’s immediate neighbour, Radio Liberté Lisala director Erick Ngunde was arrested on 13 February 2021 after hosting a programme about political tension in the province. Although now released, he has been suspended from working as a journalist. In the eastern city of Goma, Radio UB-FM reporter Nanou Kazaku sustained a gunshot injury while covering a demonstration on 17 February 2021. (7)

''The human rights situation in the DRC has reportedly deteriorated under president Felix Tshisekedi’s watch. His administration is accused of increasingly cracking down on the media and activist groups during its two years in office.  In January 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 109 cases of arbitrary arrests and harassment had been recorded over the past year. Many victims were journalists, who faced intimidation, threats, and sometimes beatings.'' (6)

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The medical information and protective guidlines of DRC government on Covid-19 are similar to WHO (see 3, 4, 5, 6), but the government was using and producing hydroxychloroquine in Q2 of 2020:

''In March 2020 President Felix Tshisekedi declared that it was "urgent" to produce chloroquine "in industrial quantities"'' (1, 2).
''In June 2020, The DRC launched the 200mg antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine on the local market, in order to use it in the treatment of the new coronavirus, Covid-19. A laboratory has also been set up in South Kivu in the east of the country to locally produce the national needs for this drug.'' (7)

There is no info found on whether the government continues using chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement.

*Comments*:
 According to Human Rights Watch, "Between March and July 2020, as large public gatherings were banned under the state of emergency aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19, security forces used excessive and often lethal force to break up demonstrations." (2). 
 
'Days after DRC announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On 29 March 2020, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On 30 March 2020, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''Local media reported that on 21 May 2020, a PNC officer shot and killed a protester in Beni, North Kivu Province. The victim, Freddy Kambale, a member of the youth activist group “Fight for Change” (LUCHA), was protesting continued insecurity in the region. Police responding to the protest initially stated the march was in violation of national Covid-19-related state of emergency provisions, which prohibited any gatherings larger than 20. Local observers testified that only 20 persons were present at the protest. On 13 July 2020, a military court found the police officer in question guilty of murder and sentenced him to life in prison.'' (1) 

''On 9 June 2020, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 The police has been dealing with the enforcement of the measures: 

''The primary responsibility for law enforcement and public order lies with the Congolese National Police, which operates under the Ministry of the Interior. The National Intelligence Agency, overseen by the presidency, is responsible for internal and external intelligence. The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the military intelligence service operate under the control of the Ministry of Defense and are primarily responsible for external security but in reality focus almost exclusively on internal security.''
