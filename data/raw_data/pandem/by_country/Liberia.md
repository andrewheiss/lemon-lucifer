## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Initially, the government declared a national health emergency under the Public Health Law Title 33 (Chapter 14) Liberian Code of Laws Revised. On April 9 2020, a state of emergency was declared in accordance with Articles 85, 86, 87 and 88 of the Liberian constitution. This state of emergency expired on July 21 2020 and a revised national health emergency was announced on July 22 2020. This National Health Emergency is still in force, and became the main legal instrument after the state of emergency ended. Thus, this is coded as 2 from the first period without the state of emergency and onward.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

*Comments*:
 According to article 88 of the Liberian constitution, the legislature needs to approve the declaration of a State of Emergency by the President, within 72 hours, or the declaration is automatically revoked. There is no requirement that the legislature approves the National Health Emergency however, which can be declared by the Health Minister if the spread of a dangerous disease exists within the country. This is therefore coded 0 for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The Liberian constitution, article 86a states that: "...Acting pursuant thereto, the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees contained in this Constitution and exercise such other emergency powers as may be necessary and appropriate to take care of the emergency." According to the constitution certain rights cannot be suspended and the legislature must approve and can revoke the SOE. Thus, for the duration of the State of Emergency, the government ruled by decree to a large extent, and with broad powers, but these were constrained by legislative oversight and within certain bounds. Article 87a also states that "Emergency powers do not include the power to suspend or abrogate the Constitution [or] dissolve the Legislature...". 3.3. of the Executive Law also provides the president with the right to declare curfews or quarantines, etc. The state of emergency ended on July 21 2020. Under the public health law § 14.2. the minister of health has extended rights to deal with the emergency. Paragraph 14.2 of the public health act maps out the powers of the minister of health under a declaration of a national health emergency, which allows for various measures to limit the spread of diseases (limiting assemblies and movement, strengthening health care and the like), but does not provide for any arbitrary interpretation of what is Covid-19 related nor any general emergency powers beyond those related to limiting the spread of a disease. The chapter in the Public Health Law makes no mention of the legislatures role in this, and the minister of health has the sole responsibility over these efforts. This is therefore coded 2 Q3 and onward where the public health law is the main legal instrument, as the minister of health has the right to rule by decree, but what the minister is authorized to do is delineated and only disease-related.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The measures apply to all of Liberia. During the first two weeks of the state of emergency, "residents within the borders of Montserrado County, Margibi County, Nimba County, and Grand Kru County are to STAY AT HOME". Also prior to this, the counties of Montserrado and Margibi were on lockdown for 21 days as part of the national health emergency. Since then, all measure have been taken nationwide, and this is therefore coded 0 after Q3 of 2020.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 On April 29 2020, Liberia's solicitor general said that the government would shut down news outlets and seize equipment from journalists alleged to have disseminated fake news. Also, media are forced to suspend printing due to lockdown restrictions, thus limiting their reach. Also, the Liberian constitution, article 15a: "Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression ... save during an emergency declared" Article 86a: "...the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees..." But the measures themselves have been argued to explicitly target fake news and violations of lockdown.
However, these actions were taken under the state of emergency, which ended on 2020-07-21. No evidence of these measures having been enforced after that, nor that it was replaced with any other de jure limitations to media. This is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 of 2020.

 The media limitations are made under the authority of the declaration of State of Emergency (articles 85, 86, 87, and 88 of the constitution), which allows the President to "suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees" during a State of Emergency. The date is the start date for the State of Emergency declaration (variable emstart).

## Media limitations end (*melimend*) 

*Question*: When do the de-jure limits on media freedom end?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Provide the exact date the emergency measures with de-jure limitations on media freedoms (*medialimits*) are set to expire. If the exact date is unknown, give the final day of the month. If there are no de-jure limits on media freedoms (melim=0) or there is no defined end date, leave blank.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Several sources provided point to harassment of journalists and limits on reporting under the umbrella of "fake news" or "misinformation" back to April 2020.
"In Liberia, the justice authorities have threatened to close down or seize any news organization that publishes what they consider to be false information." (1) 
There is much less reporting on the media situation in Liberia after Q2 of 2020, and the de jure limitation in place on media under the state of emergency seem to have ended when the state of emergency ended on 2020-07-21. The US state department in their human rights report also report that media in Liberia is relatively free, although issues such as self-censorship and government-owned media outlets exist. From the evidence found on this after the end of the limitation to media freedom under the state of emergency, there is not any limitations in place that indicates this should be coded as 1. This is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 and onwards, as no evidence of any limitations to Covid-19 reporting has been found after the end of the state of emergency.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

*Comments*:
 Several instances of journalists being harassed have been reported. One example is a journalist that was attacked by LDEA agents with the apparent aim of preventing him from reporting that around 100 people attended the wake in violation of a ban on large gatherings.
There are further reports of journalists getting attacked and arrested, however, these instances are not connected to the reporting about Covid-19 and/or the governments response.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 "[On] April 29, Deputy Information Minister Eugene Fahngon told reporters that existing press passes, which journalists use to move freely amid the lockdown, would be voided and new ones issued [...]".

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

However, this was part of the measures taken within the state of emergency, and is reported to have ended by the time the state of emergency ended. No evidence of any other limitations to information in relation to Covid-19 has been found, and this is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 and onward.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents verbally harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have verbally harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic.

Another journalist felt threatened after being pressured to reveal his sources on a story on the upcoming lockdown. However, no reports of any threats or other verbal harassment toward journalists has been found in the later periods, and this is therefore only coded 1 in the first period.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The information from the government is similar to the information from WHO. However, Liberia received a consignment from the Madagascar's president. WHO advises that there is no proof of its efficiency for the "Covid Organics" medicine (a herbal tonic touted as a cure for  Covid-19). No evidence of any other disinformation in later periods has been found, and this is therefore coded 0 for the other periods.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 During the beginning weeks of the lockdown, security forces used truncheons enforcing the restrictions. On 16 April 2020, soldiers enforcing lockdown rules entered homes and injured residents in Slipway and Crown communities. Three Liberian soldiers have been recalled after a woman was stabbed in the arm. One of them was later found guilty of assaulting the woman.
No further evidence was found that indicates that security forces, such as the civilian police or military, has engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures later on. This is therefore coded 0 for all the other periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
