## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The Israeli Prime Minister declared a state of emergency on March 19 2020, based on Article 38 and 39 in the constitution (technically, Israel has been in a state of emergency since 1948, but the declaration that this also constituted an emergency situation enabled the government to use emergency regulations, which is the instrument applied under a state of emergency in Israel – so this effectively constitutes a state of emergency declaration even though such a state of emergency was already in place). This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within existing legal framework. On July 21 2020, Israel passed a new and temporary law called the Coronavirus Law (formally,  Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020) that gives government extended powers during a state of emergency as well as allowing them to declare it for 60 days instead of 7 days. The initial state of emergency and extensions of it were taken under the articles mentioned above, but the current are taken under this new Coronavirus Law. While this temporary law is new (and has a sunset clause on 2021-06-30), they have still declared a state of emergency under it, and this is therefore coded as 1 rather than 4. The state of emergency has been extended multiple times under the Coronavirus Law, and is currently set to end on June 29 2021.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: Article 39: State of Emergency

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020

 

*Comments*:
 There has been a state of emergency in place throughout the coded period, but the SoE was initially based on Article 39 of the constitution. As of the passing of the Coronavirus Law, this has been the legal instrument under which the SoE is based.

## Beginning of emergency response (*emstart*) 

*Question*: When did the government first adopt this legal instrument in response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This refers to the date that the legal instrument defined in emlaw was first used to enact a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  If the exact date is unknown, the first day of the month is given.  If unknown, leave blank.

*Comments*:
 There has been a state of emergency in place throughout the coded period, but the SoE was initially based on Article 39 of the constitution. As of the passing of the Coronavirus Law on July 21 2020, this has been the legal instrument under which the SoE is based. Therefore, this has two different start dates, although an SoE in relation to Covid-19 has been in place throughout the coded period.

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Article 38 of the Israeli constitution, Declaring a State of Emergency, states that the Knesset can declare a state of emergency for a maximum time limit of one year (with possibility of extension), and that the government can declare a state of emergency with the maximum time limit of 7 days (with the possiblity of extension, and the possible termination of the state of the emergency if the Knesset votes in favour of ending it). This state of emergency is the latter, declared by the government, and thus had an initial time limit of 7 days although they have extended it afterwards. Note that since July 21 2020, there's a new (temporary) law regulating state's of emergency that gives government extended powers during an SoE related to Covid-19, as well as the right to declare it for a longer time. See comments and sources under emleglimit for more information. It has been extended for 60 days a number of times, and the SoE is currently set to end on 2021-06-29.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2021-05-01

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2021-06-29

 

*Comments*:
 The initial end date for the state of emergency was March 26 2020, as the maximum amount of days the government is allowed to declare a state of emergency before they need to renew it is 7 days. This SOE was extended multiple times, and the final extension in Q2 was set to July 2, which is therefore the date recorded in that period. On July 21 2020 a new temporary law regulating SOE's was introduced that gives the government extended powers during it, as well as a right to declare it for longer time periods (see comments and sources under emleglimit for more information). The last end date set for the SoE in Q3 was therefore November 6 2020. In October 2020, the SOE was extended from this date to January 3 2021, and is therefore the date recorded for Q4. It was later extended until 2021-03-21, and again to 2021-05-01 (which was the last extension during Q1 of 2021), and then in April it was extended to 2021-06-29 which is the current end date.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 The constitution states that both the government and the parliament can declare a state of emergency, but that a government-declared state of emergency has a much shorter time limit and can be terminated by the parliament. This was a state of emergency declared by the government, and the parliament did thus not approve it. Note that the system for declaring states of emergencies (and how long they have effect) has been changed by the entrance of the Coronavirus Law (see comments and sources for emlaw for more information), but the SoE is the same in the sense that the government introduced it and parliament did not vote on it.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The new parliament was sworn in on 16 March 2020, and some committees and regular work was not fully up and running at the end of March 2020, and only a certain amount of MPs were initially allowed in the Plenary at the same time due to health reasons. The Knesset did not work according to a regular programe, but rather focused its work on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is once again convening fully, however. Note also that the parliament was temporarily closed for four days during Q2 of 2020 due to the speaker refusing to obey the regulations and initiate elections for a new speaker, but his actions were overruled by the court, a new speaker was chosen and parliamentary work resumed - this four day hiatus is not linked to any emergency measures, but was an act of the previous speaker himself that caused it. However, the SoE provided the government with fairly broad capacity to impose restrictions on Covid-19 related issues, and the parliament’s role remained limited when using this SoE. This is therefore coded as 2, since the government could impose restrictions related to Covid-19 without needing parliamentary approval. 
On July 21 2020 the Knesset passed the Coronavirus Law, which now underlines the governments emergency response, and in which they were given extended emergency powers during a state of emergency, as well as the right to declare it for 60 days rather than 7. Within this law, Government is also allowed to rule by decree on measures related to Covid-19 that is deemed acute and cannot be passed through parliament first. However, this law fairly strictly pertains to issues related to the emergency itself (and the powers only exist as long as the SOE is in place), and the parliament still has powers to review the passing of emergency legislation to later terminate it, as well as being able to terminate the state of emergency itself. Therefore, this is coded as 2 here as well  - the government can rule by decree on a number of Covid-19 related issues - from the point where this new law came into effect.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have mostly been taken nationwide. However, some regions and areas have been subject to further restrictions and measures than the country as a whole in the Jul-Sep period, where some sub-national variation existed. This sub-national variation has as far as have been seen not travelled into to Oct-Dec period, where it is again uniform measures across the country. During 2021, all restrictions and the subsequent reopening has been nationwide. This is therefore coded 2 in the Jul-Sep period, and 0 in the others.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There are numerous reports of Israel’s policies on the Gaza Strip and West Bank leave Palestinians more exposed to Covid-19, and with less access to health care. Especially, the imposed travel ban on Palestinian territory by the Israeli government has caused concern of numerous Palestinians not being able to access sufficient health care if Covid-19 starts spreading widely. However, the policies toward these territories and the people living there are not related to the Covid-19 crisis, and have been in place long before that. Furthermore, no evidence has been found that the Israeli government has imposed any other regulations that restrict any democratic freedoms more for some groups. Thus, to the extent that Israeli policies actively discriminate Palestinians or other groups democratic rights, these have been in place before the crisis and are not related to the emergency response. Also noteworthy is that some Ultra-Orthodox representatives in Israel have argued that they are subject to discrimination from the governments Covid-19 policy as some areas where these communities live and operate have been targeted with heavy restrictions that also limit their capacity to practice their faith, but this has according to officials been entirely motivated by the significant spread of Covid-19 in these communities and their lack of measures to contain it themselves. This also seems  correct, and is thus not regarded as discrimination, as the Israeli policy has been to try and contain the spread in areas where it has spread most intensely with specific measures. This is therefore coded as 0. Israel has also been criticized for not granting vaccinations to Palestinians while introducing mass vaccination to the Israeli citizens. However, this does not infringe on democratic rights as such and is therefore not accounted for here.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 No violations of non-derogable rights have been found in the emergency response to Covid-19. While Israel are accused of violating numerous rights in their conflict with Palestine, these measures are previous to and not related to the Covid-19 response, and no specific elements of the emergency response has been found to violate any non-derogable rights in Israel. This is therefore coded as 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There are a few isolated reports of violence from police in enforcing emergency measures, primarily in relation to using what has been regarded excessive force in response to protests of the emergency measures and/or people refusing to comply to some regulations like wearing face masks. The reports do not indicate widespread violence, and the sources are mostly local media outlets. However, the US state department in their human rights report state that arbitrary arrest and similar excessive force has been used in relation to protests and the like, citing Covid-19 violations, for instance during October of 2020. No evidence has been found that this type of excessive force has stopped, and it has been reported in several periods. At the same time, no reports of any serious injuries or lethal violence has been found. Furthermore, since no reports of this has been found in Q2 of 2021, in which Israel has also removed nearly all restrictions on it’s citizens, this is coded as 0 for Q2 2021 given no evidence and very few restrictions in place that are enforced. 
Note also that the ongoing violence in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel is not regarded here, as this violence is not connected to the emergency measures, and Covid-19 has not been used as an excuse for such violence by the Israeli government or authorities.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 Military personnel has been deployed in Israel to help enforce emergency measures during the first two periods. However, no reports have been found about this in Q4 of 2020 and later, and this is therefore coded 0 from there on.
