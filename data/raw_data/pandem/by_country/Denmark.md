## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The Danish government proposed an amedment to the Act on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Epidemiloven) that grants the Minister of Health powers that include limiting gatherings of people, prohibiting access to means of transportation and order people who are suspected of being infected to isolate. This amendment is the legal instrument through which the initial emergency measures were taken, and this is therefore coded as 4. The amendment had a sunset clause set to a year, from 2020-03-01 to 2021-03-01. When this amendment expired, it was replaced with a permanent Epidemic Act (in danish also called Epidemiloven) that was prepared and debated in parliament during the fall and winter of 2020. This new and permanent Epidemic Act includes most of possible measures and powers of the temporary amendment, but due to the permanent nature also includes much more parliamentary oversight, veto rights and judicial review of actions taken, and especially so for the more intervening measures. Thus, the new epidemics act solidifies the Danish authorities powers to take measures to mitigate Covid-19 (and other similar diseases) spread if considered to have devastating enough effect on health and society, but it distributes the power of this act to more instances than the government, as well as introduces checks and balances onto the measures taken. Thus, the legal instrument changed as of Q2 in 2021, but it is still a new legislation not representing any state of emergency and thus coded 4 here as well.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: Act no. 133 of 12 March 2020 amending the Danish on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Expansion of measures to prevent and contain contamination and to secure capacity resources, etc.)

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: Act no. 133 of 12 March 2020 amending the Danish on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Expansion of measures to prevent and contain contamination and to secure capacity resources, etc.)

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: Act no. 133 of 12 March 2020 amending the Danish on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Expansion of measures to prevent and contain contamination and to secure capacity resources, etc.)

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: Act no. 133 of 12 March 2020 amending the Danish on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Expansion of measures to prevent and contain contamination and to secure capacity resources, etc.)

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: Epidemiloven (Epidemics Act)

 

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 in 2020 and Q1 in 2021, the legal instrument was an amendment with the above title, but which was generally referred to as the Epidemics Act. As of March 1 2021, Denmark instituted a permanent law to handle Covid-19 (and other communicable diseases) which is simply named Epidemiloven (Epidemics Act), and this is thus the name for Q2 in 2021.

## Beginning of emergency response (*emstart*) 

*Question*: When did the government first adopt this legal instrument in response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This refers to the date that the legal instrument defined in emlaw was first used to enact a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  If the exact date is unknown, the first day of the month is given.  If unknown, leave blank.

 

*Scale*: Date format.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2020-03-17

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2021-03-01

 

*Comments*:
 The government proposed the amendment on March 12 2021, but it came into force on the 17 of March 2021. This amendment ended due to its sunset clause on March 1 2021, and was replaced with a permanent law. Thus, in Q2, there’s a new starting date signifying a new law.

## End of emergency response (*emend*) 

*Question*: When did the implementation of this legal instrument end?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the date that the implementation of the legal instrument mentioned in *emlaw* ended. Leave blank if the implementation of the legal instrument has not ended time of coding. Please only consider the legal instrument mentioned in *emlaw*.

*Comments*:
 Implementation of legal instrument has not ended by time of coding. The amendment that was in place from 2020-03-17-2021-03-01 has ended, but it was replaced with the permanent Epidemics Act which in terms of available measures etc. is very similar to the initial amendment. The legal instrument was thus replaced with a very similar one, and therefore this is not regarded to have ended as such.

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No end date for some or all provisions. 
 1. Yes.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The first major measures taken were to limit social gatherings to 10 people as well as closing night clubs, bars etc. on the 18 of March 2020, and these were initially set to the 30 of March 2020. There have been different time limits for different measures during the coded period. However, the legal instrument these measures were taken under had a sunset clause set to 2021-03-01, and was then terminated. It was replaced with a permanent law which includes many of the powers of the initial amendment, but also much more oversight, judicial review etc. From 2021-03-01, there is thus no time limit on the legal instrument used to implement measures related to Covid-19, but as far as have been seen, there are time limits on all measures taken under this new law (in general, each measure can not be in place more than 4 weeks at a time, although some longer time periods can be used in exceptions - the amount of time a disease can be regarded as dangerous to society as a whole also has a time limit of 6 months at a time). This is therefore coded as 1 for Q2 in 2021 as well, as there seem to be no measures under it that can or is be implemented indefinetly although the law as an instrument is permanent.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

 

*Scale*: Date format.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2021-03-31

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2021-09-01

 

*Comments*:
 There have been different time limits for different measures, and extensions of some of them, but the legal instrument under which these measures are taken has a sunset clause on 31 of March 2021, and this is therefore the date coded here. After this legal instrument expired, it was replaced with a similar but permanent legal instrument which in itself has no end date. However, all measures taken under it have end dates, and the general time limit for each measure is four weeks. Denmark made a larger reopening and relaxing of restrictions on April 21 2021. They are expected to relax some further measures on May 2021, by not extending some measures. The different measures have individual time limits, most of which are currently set to end sometime in June 2021. The restriction on assembly, which is one of the main restrictions, has an expiry date on 2021-09-01 currently (although this is for the restriction of no more than 500 people in one place – the current restriction of no more than 50 people is set to expire on 2021-06-11). As this is a central restriction, which is currently set to be expired in full on 2021-09-01, this is the date coded for Q2 of 2021.  Note however that they can still be extended, and new measures could be reintroduced as well.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 Yes, the parliament made a fast-track approvement of the amendment in order for it to come into effect. The parliament also had to approve the permanent law that came into effect on 2021-03-01. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The legal instrument, the amendment, does not affect the parliaments lawmaking role. It does provide the Health Minister some extraordinary power, but these powers are defined and demarcated in the amendment that parliament passed, and does not provide measures that could impact the lawmaking role of the parliament as such. When the legal instrument changed to the permanent law in Q2 of 2021, the same principles applied as far as I’ve seen, along with extensions into how parliament can oversee and scrutinize measures taken under it (as well as other instances such as judiciaries). Furthermore, when the government during the fall of 2020 proposed to replace the temporary amendment of the epidemics act with a permanent new law containing virtually the same powers, this was strongly rejected by parliament. This led the government to strike a deal with most parties of the parliament, thus involving them in the process of drafting the law. Thus, the initial permanent legislation proposed by the government could have undermined parliamentary scrutiny and power in the longer run, but it was turned down by the opposition and they arrived at a version of it that as far as has been found has no limiting effect on parliaments power. Finally, parliament has stayed active and working during the pandemic, and as stated been involved in drafting new legislation, as well as approving both the temporary amendment and the permanent law. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, I haven't found any record of sub-national variation in the policy response to Covid-19. All emergency measures are handled by the Danish Government. In Q3 of 2020, more restrictive measures were declared in the Copenhagen area and Odense Municipality. In Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021, No  record of sub-national variation in the policy response to Covid-19 was found in this time period. Denmark has had substantial restrictions nationally, and also seem to have opened up at the same pace and time nationally.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 Neither Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International nor EU agency for fundamental rights have reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures. There have been a couple of larger demonstrations on restrictions against Covid-19 during Q1 and Q2 of 2021, but no indication has been found that police have used excessive force during these. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
