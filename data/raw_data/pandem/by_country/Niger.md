## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Niger declared (4) a nationwide state of emergency to be applied from 27 March 2020 through an executive decree (2, 3). The state of emergency was instituted according to article 68 of Constitution (1) and law n ° 98-024 of 11 August 1998, modified and updated by law 2015-07 of 2015: on the application of the provisions on emergency - extraordinary measures. This Law could not be located.  

It is often referred to as a State of Public Health Emergency, mainly due to the fact that Niger, and the rest of Sahel region, are under a state of emergency due to security reasons. 
However, the constitution does not differentiate between a state of emergency and a state of health emergency, but instead has provisions only for a state of emergency (therefore coded as 1).  

The state of emergency due to Covid-19 has been prolonged several times (see e.g. 5, 6) and it has been last extended through 5 August 2021 (7). 
During Q1 of 2021, the state of emergency was prolonged on 5 January 2021 (see 8), and then prolonged again for 3 months in April 2021 (see 9).

*Comments*:
 The Nigerien legislature adopted unanimously (90 votes in favor, zero against and zero abstentions) on 11 April 2020 the bill extending the State of Emergency until 11 July 2020 (1, 2). 
When the President announced the declaration of the State of Emergency on 27 March 2020 (3, 4), he did not specify an end date. A limit date was added on 11 April 2020, when the bill was approved by the National Assembly, and further extended until 11 July 2020. The initial declaration of the State of Emergency did not require the approval of the Parliament.

The Nigerien Parliament approved the extension of the SoE in October 2020 for a period of three months, until 10 January 2021 (see 5). This extension - from July 2020 to October 2020 - was not voted in Parliament, but the government had already secured authorization to legislate by Ordinance during parliamentary inter-session periods: 
''This draft ordinance is made in accordance with law n ° 2020-030 of 2 July 2020, empowering the Government to issue ordinances during parliamentary inter-session and this, after opinion of the Constitutional Court. '' (see 6, 7).

The National Assembly adopted in the plenary of 8 April 2021 a Bill ratifying Ordinance No. 2021-01 of 5 January 2021, extending the state of health emergency throughout the territory of the Republic of Niger (see 8). 

Further, the National Assembly adopted a bill with 90 votes in favor, 19 against and zero (0) abstentions that extends, by three months, the state of emergency throughout the territory of Niger for the period from 5 May 2021 to 05 August 2021 (see 9).

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The Constitution (1) -  article 67 is vague with regards to to executive decree powers in emergency circumstances: 

"the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures demanded by these circumstances after official consultation of the Prime Minister, of the President of the National Assembly and of the President of the Constitutional Court. ...No institution of the Republic may be dissolved or suspended during the exercise of the exceptional powers. The exceptional measures must be inspired by the will to assure to the constitutional public powers, within the shortest time periods, the means to accomplish their mission."
''The National Assembly is required to approve with an absolute majority of its members the duration of the exercise of the emergency powers and to terminate them in the case of abuse.''

The SoE is declared using a combination of art 67 of the Constitution and the Law ''no 98-24 du 11 août 1998 portant réglementation de l'Etat d'urgence'', modified and updated by law ''2015-07 of 2015'' (see e.g. 2). This law could not be located. 

Nevertheless, the Nigerien Parliament, on 2 July 2020, approved the law ''n ° 2020-030, empowering the Government to issue ordinances during parliamentary inter-session and this, after opinion of the Constitutional Court.'' (see 3, 4). The government therefore seems to secured authorization to legislate by Ordinance during parliamentary inter-session periods in July 2020. 

Further, the Nigerien Parliament has approved the extensions of the SoE: 
- On 11 April 2020, the legislature approved the bill extending the State of Emergency until 11 July 2020 (5);
- In October 2020, the bill extending the SoE until 10 January 2021 (6); 
- In 8 April 2021, the bill ratifying Ordinance No. 2021-01 of 5 January 2021, extending the state of health emergency for 3 months (7); 
- On 8 May 2021, the bill extending the SoE to 5 August 2021 (8). 

Also, there has been ongoing oversight in Parliament and limits on decree powers: 
''The continuous functioning of parliament and its vigilance with regard to government action are a guarantee of good governance. Under the state of health emergency, the government and security forces have exceptional powers and the exercise of human rights is considerably limited. However, the balance that is imposed on control must take into account the need to protect the population against the pandemic as much as ensuring individual rights and limiting the abuse of power.” (9).

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II).

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The Nigerien authorities have been using chloroquine since March 2020 in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. 
In May 2020, ''The Health Ministry decided to continue the medical care of patients with Covid-19 through the current protocol in force based on chloroquine associated with azithromycin. This, despite the recent publication of a study concluding that they are ineffective against this pandemic....For Niger, this treatment "remains at this date the only alternative pending a new protocol", explains the government in a press release'' (1)
No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
