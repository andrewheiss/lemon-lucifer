## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Gabon declared a state of emergency on 10 April 2020, according to the Constitution (1) (art. 25 on the state of emergency or seige), and the law n°11/90 of 16 November 1990 on the state of emergency (2), with the decree n°00100/PR/PM of 10 April 2020 (3, 4).
On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and was institutionally replaced by a state of health emergency, brought about with a new law (based on Constitution, article 47) allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days, which was renewed for additional days. Under the new law, the state of (health) emergency continued, although under a different legal instrument (5). 

The state of emergency has been in place continuously since March 2020, after consecutive renewals. After 11 May 2020, the legal instrument used has been article 47 of the Constitution, and all renewals of the state of emergency were based on -and amending - law n ° 003/2020 of 11 May 2020 (6, 7).

*Comments*:
 On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under this new law, the state of emergency and related measures have been re-declared and extended several times. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on 3 October 2020 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November 2020, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on 15 November 2020, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. 

The government has been continuously prolonging for 45 days each time the state of health emergency up until June 2021. The latest extension runs through 28 June 2021 (10).

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

The new law under Constitution art 47 giving the executive special powers was also approved by the National Assembly on 11 May 2020 (4). 

All later extensions of the state of health emergency have been approved by the National Assembly (see for example 5, 6, 7). 

However, there have been criticisms against the government for delaying to get parliament authorization for some of the extensions (see 8, 9, 10).

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was implemented in Q2 2020 based on Article 25 Constitution (2), and law n°11/90 of 16 November 1990 on the state of emergency. 

Art.25 mentions: ''The President may, when circumstances require it, after deliberation with the Council of Ministers and consultation of the Bureaus of the National Assembly and the Senate, proclaim by decree a state of urgency or a state of siege, that will confer to the President special powers within the conditions determined by the law.''
Article 4, law of state of emergency (7): ''The Government is authorized, during the duration of the state of emergency, to take any restrictive measures required by the circumstances.''
Law n°002/2020 of 25 April 2020 on the duration of the state of emergency was approved by the National Assembly which extended it for 15 more days. 

During Q3, Q4 of 2020, and Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the state of health emergency was implemented based on art47 of the constitution, that gives extra powers to the executive. 
Art. 47 (2): ''Besides cases expressly provisioned by the Constitution, the law fixes the rules concerning: The state of watch, urgency, alert and siege;''. 
The National Assembly has granted authorization for the declaration of the state of emergency and the new law of 11 May 2020, as well as for later extensions (see 3--6).

Also, there have been social distancing measures in place, and a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry dedicated to the control and evaluation of the management of Covid-19 (1).

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ.

*Comments*:
 In the first months of Q2 2020, the state of emergency and the night curfew were nationwide, but there were a few areas under stricter confinement (Libreville, Owendo, Akanda, Ntoum, and Pointe Denis) (1). 
On 28 April 2020, the government eased lockdown measures in the Grand Libreville area, including the communes of Libreville, Owendo, Akanda, Ntoum, and the Pointe-Denis peninsula. The new measures replaced a total lockdown with a curfew between the hours of 17:00 and 07:00. (2) 

In Q3 and Q4 of 2020, the state of health emergency and the curfew are nationwide (3, 4). 
In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the state of health emergency and the curfew are nationwide, but entry and exit to Greater Libreville is further restricted (5, 6).

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS of 10 April 2020 (1), designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to Covid-19, does not exempt journalists and the media from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures. 

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by June 2021.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid-19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Gabonese authorities have been using chloroquine in the treatment against Covid-19 since March 2020 (1).
''The Minister of Health, on 28 May 2020, after a meeting with the Scientific Committee and the Technical Committee on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 in Gabon after the revelations of the scientific journal " The Lancet " and the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to stop current therapeutic trials, decided that the treatment with chloroquine would be continued with caution and that the Lopinavir / Ritonavir combination as indicated in the national therapeutic protocol could be an alternative to hydroxychloroquine if necessary.'' (3)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
