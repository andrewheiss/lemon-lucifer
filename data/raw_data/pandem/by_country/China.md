## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures a region will implement, with level 1 the most serious. Officials in the different regions are separately in charge of their own areas. The emergency response law is triggered when the region goes into level 1. However, the measures that can be taken according to the emergency response law is very vague [3]. These laws have been enacted since January 2020.

I have not found evidence of the Chinese government triggering the emergency response law in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 Article 7 of the emergency law states "The people's governments at the county level shall be responsible for responding to emergencies which occur within their own administrative areas; where two or more administrative areas are involved in an emergency, the people's government at the next higher level, which the people's governments of the said administrative areas are subordinate to, shall assume responsibility, or the people's governments at the next higher level of the respective people governments of the said administrative areas shall jointly assume responsibility. Where the people's government at the county level at the place where an emergency occurs is unable to eliminate or keep under effective control the serious social harm caused by the emergency, it shall, in a timely manner, report the matter to the people's government at a higher level, which shall take timely measures and exercise unified leadership in handling the emergency.'

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 The BBC source explains that the emergency measures have varied across regions based on the severity of the spread of Covid-19. Examples include:

1: The region of Urumqi was locked down in July 2020 after multiple infections were detected in the region.

2: In October 2020, China started testing the residents in Qingdao (population: 9 million) for Covid-19 after 12 cases were found within the city.

3: The emergency measures have continued to vary on the provincial level in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. For example, new restrictions such as stay home orders and restrictions on people entering and leaving the city of Foshan were implemented on 1 June 2021.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 In the city of Guangzhou, the authorities targeted Africans for compulsory testing and quarantine. The government also imposed more draconian restrictions in the Xinjiang region, home to a large Uyghur population, than in other parts of the country. People in Xinjiang were physically locked into their homes, and some were handcuffed to railings on the street; detainees were forced to take traditional medicine and were sprayed with acidic disinfectant.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 People living in Urumqi in Xinjiang were physically locked into their homes from 18 July 2020 until September 2020. Social media accounts also show the front doors of some houses being sealed with metal bars to prevent residents from leaving their homes and breaching the quarantine regulations. Footage on social media suggest that people who attempted to leave their apartments were handcuffed to the rails in public streets during the lockdown. Detainees were subjected to torture-like treatment. One woman testifies to the Assocated Press that “...when she was detained at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak, she was forced to drink a medicine that made her feel weak and nauseous. She and others in her cell had to strip naked once a week as guards hosed them and their cells down with disinfectant, she said.  ‘It was scalding,’ recounted the woman by phone from Xinjiang, declining to be named out of fear of retribution. ‘My hands were ruined, my skin was peeling.’ “ (1) Although the strict lockdown eased in later months, there is no evidence suggesting that the general treatment of citizens in the Xinjiang region, in relation to Covid-19, has improved in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 1: Chinese politicians downplayed the severity of the virus in its early weeks prior to 11 March 2020. Police also target “rumourmongers” and censors deleted any commentary that question the official line. On 1 January 2020, the government arrested eight whistleblower doctors accused of spreading rumours about Covid-19.

2: Fang Bin a textile trader living in Wuhan documented the state of saturation in hospitals in a video that was uploaded on 25 January 2020. He was later arrested and his laptop confiscated for the reporting that he had done. 

3: Citizen journalists have been gone missing, found to have been detained and ‘formally indicted on charges of spreading false information’. According to reports, these individuals were reporting on Covid-19 – on the prevalence of the virus and the governments response.

4: Journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years imprisonment in December 2020 on the charge of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" for reporting live from the city of Wuhan during the Covid outbreak.  

I have not found specific instances of de-facto limitations in media reporting about the nature of Covid-19 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. However, multiple sources have reported that censorship and media control in China has gotten worse since the start of the pandemic. Hence, I have continued to code merepfact as 1 for both Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Many critical voices questioning the government’s management and response to Covid-19 have been silenced. Examples of this are listed below.

1: Reporters Without Borders has reported that Beijing has been using its ambassadors to “launch an all-out attack campaign against media that publish critical stories linked to the pandemic and China”. 

2: Political commentator Ren Zhiqiang disappeared after denouncing the regime’s shortcomings.

3: Three journalists were arrested for publishing information related to the epidemic. 

4: On May 8 2020, New York Times foreign correspondent Chris Buckley, who had spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the pandemic was forced out of China after the authorities refused to renew his visa.

5: Citizen journalists have been gone missing, found to have been detained and ‘formally indicted on charges of spreading false information’. According to reports, these individuals were reporting on Covid-19 – on the prevalence of the virus and the governments response.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 The Chinese government has maintained very tight control over the media since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. While there are foreign journalists and news agencies working in China, they encounter multiple obstacles while working in the field. According to Reporters sans Frontières, "more than 115 currently detained, often in conditions that pose a threat to their lives." (1)

Beijing has expelled least 14 international journalists since March 2020. Most recently, two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

I have not found instances of the government placing de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid 19 related news but with reference to the pandemic in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang". [3] 

2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 

3: Chinese journalist was arrested on 15 May in Shanghai for commenting on the authorities\ countermeasures on Twitter.

4: Two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

5: Newsweek has reported that the government has been routinely restricting media access to to information about the nature of Covid-19.  I have not found specific cases of this in 2021. However as the media situation in China has not improved, I continue to code the variable as 2.

I have coded this as verbal harassment as they were asked/forced to leave the country and no physical harm was inflicted upon them.

I have not found new instances of the government and its agents limiting journalists reporting about Covid-19. However the above mentioned journalists continue to be banned from reporting and working in China. The media situation in China has also not improved. Hence, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 The media in China is very tightly controlled and multiple journalists have been jailed after reporting on various aspects of Covid-19.  For example, Zhang Zhan, a Chinese citizen journalist who covered Wuhan's Covid-19 outbreak was jailed for four years in December 2020. She was found guilty of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble". Reporters without Borders have also reported that harrassment of foreign correspondents in China intensified during Covid-19.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Documents were leaked to CNN, indicating that China under-reported cases in March: “The documents show a wide-range of data on two specific days, February 10 and March 7, that is often at odds with what officials said publicly at the time. … Even though China has never revealed the total number of Covid-19 cases in 2019, a graph in one document appears to suggest a much higher number [than what they reported] had been detected. ... According to reports in Chinese state media in early February, Hubei health experts had expressed frustration with the accuracy of nucleic acid tests. ...the tests carried out at that time resulted in only a 30% to 50% positive rate, among already confirmed cases... ” (1) 

“One of the team’s investigators has already said China refused to give raw data on early COVID-19 cases to the WHO-led team, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the global pandemic began.” (2)

A Bayesian estimate of the under-reporting rate for COVID-19: “...we estimate that due to significant under reporting of the virus in China, the true mortality due to COVID-19 is less than half that currently reported, and the true number of cases is at least twice the number currently reported. … This misreporting most likely arises because patients experiencing mild symptoms choose to self-isolate, and do not attend hospital for testing or care. This will lead to overestimation of mortality rates and underestimation of prevalence of the virus in the community.“ (3)

China has been consistently suggesting without scientific proof that Covid-19 did not originate in Wuhan. Instead, a popular claim from Chinese officials is that it might have originated in the US and then brought to China. These claims have started since at least March 2020.

There are multiple reports that have been emerging in from November 2020 which discuss how China state media has been 'reporting intensively' on the fact that Covid-19 did not originate in Wuhan. I haved coded 2 based on the intensity of the Chinese government's reporting on this issue'.

A former chief epidemiologist said in a briefing 'Although China was the first to report cases, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus originated in China'. Chinese scientists have also submitting a paper for publication to the Lancet. This paper claims 'Wuhan is not the place where human-to-human Sars-CoV-2 transmission first happened'. It instead suggests that the first case have originated in the 'Indian subcontinent'.

State media and officials have been questioning the safety and effectiveness of western vaccines without basis. 

State media outlet CGTN and spokesperson from the foreign affairs ministry, have made statements claiming that Covid-19 originated in a military base in the US and not China in January 2021.

The Chinese government has also been forcing certain groups of people (namely the Uighurs) to consume a traditional medicine in the form of a herbal drink. The authorities claim that it is effective against the virus even though there is no scientific proof of this.
The government has continued to push conspiracy theories of the origin of the virus in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. Hence, I have continued to code this variable as 2.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
