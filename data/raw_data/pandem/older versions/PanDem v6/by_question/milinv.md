 The military was involved in enforcing the emergency measures, such as preventing cross-town movement, in Q2 2020. According to ICNL, "Albania’s government deployed the army to enforce a strict 40-hour curfew aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus. " (1) Since the  curfew ended on 1 June (OECD) milinv is coded as 0 in Q3 2020. I found no further information about the military's involvement in enforcing the curfew since November 2020 or other emergency measures.

 In August of 2020, the state of Victoria employed military personnel to help enforce Covid-19 regulation.

No information has been found that this has continued into Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, Reuters report that Austria is mobilizing reserve soldiers to aid various emergency measures, including the police, but there is no mentioning of them enforcing confinement measures themselves. No such indications have been found in the other sources either during Q2 and Q3, and ACAPS for instance does not report any military deployment for enforcing restrictions (although they do report that military has been used to help secure borders in order to relieve the police from these duties). This is therefore coded as 0 for Q2 and Q3 in 2020. However, Austrian authorities report that soldiers have been deployed around the borders of Tyrol, Radstadt and other places to control passings in and out of the region. The earliest reports of this are found in December 18 2020, and is currently in effect (as of May 12), and is thus coded 1 from that point onward.

 The military is involved in securing check points for traveling in Myanmar, and this is therefore coded as 1. No sources have been found stating that the military has additional tasks in the emergency measures, but the military presence is very large in Myanmar so it is possible that they have been involved in additional measures. No reports have been found on the military activity in these regards in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, but as no evidence confirming that their involvement has ceased has been found, this is assumed to be on going and coded 1 for these periods. The military presence has increased as a result of the coup, and there is no evidence suggesting that the military has relaxed it’s presence in enforcing Covid-19 restrictions such as curfews. This is therefore coded as 1 for these periods as well.

management of the country amid the emergency is made under the military junta..."

In May 2021, the military were deployed to implement the compulsory vaccination campaign. Military personnel were involved in administering and managing the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Phnom Penh.

 The military has been participating in the enforcement of the Covid-19 measures, and although we didn’t find evidence that it continued to do so throughout the pandemic, it may be more likely than in other cases because the legal instrument is the same.

*Comments*:
 The military was involved in border checks and enforcing quarantine in Litovel and Uničov municipalities in March 2020. Since end of July, the military has been involved in the "smart quarantine" project, which involves using information technology to map contacts of people who tested positive for covid-19. On 13 July, "The decision to deploy members of the Czech Armed Forces in rescue work to protect the population and prevent the spread of coronavirus was made." Since this is not part of confinement measures, military involvement is coded as 1 only during March-June 2020 period.

There is no evidence for military activity regarding Covid-19 in Q1 and Q2 2021.

 The police has been dealing with the enforcement of the measures: 

''The primary responsibility for law enforcement and public order lies with the Congolese National Police, which operates under the Ministry of the Interior. The National Intelligence Agency, overseen by the presidency, is responsible for internal and external intelligence. The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the military intelligence service operate under the control of the Ministry of Defense and are primarily responsible for external security but in reality focus almost exclusively on internal security.''

 During the first state of emergency, the Presidential Decree nº 1017 (Art. 2/Art. 4) established confinement measures and that "the national police and armed forces are responsible for ensuring compliance". Once the state of emergency was lifted, the new mandatory guidelines defined that the armed forces would "participate in security activities and public order control". The state of emergecies declared in April 2021 also defined that the national police and the armed forces would be tasked with enforcing the confinement measures (Presidential Decree nº 1282, Art. 2 and Presidential Decree nº 1291, Art. 2).

 The armed forces were tasked with enforcing the lockdown measures. Once they were lifted, they were responsible for establishing and controlling "sanitary barriers". The National Assembly argued that these were "military barriers", not sanitary, and in late October they issued a decree prohibiting the establishment of such barriers without approval of the mayor and prohibiting "intimidating and coercive use of the Armed Forces". No evidence was found of military involvement in 2021 and the confinement measure have been lifted.

 Emmanuel Macron drafted the Frech army into the coronavirus efforts, in order to help organize and support where the situation worsens by tranferring patients etc.

''The army will not be called upon to ensure the strict confinement of people as has been the case in some other countries, officials said. However, it will be used to protect strategic sites such as pharmacy depots and stockpiles of medical equipment and ventilators after a recent spate of thefts. 
It will also broaden existing efforts to shuffle patients around the country and also in France’s overseas’ territories, where two warships were dispatched this week as the situation worsens there.''

*Comments*:
 The defense and security forces are responsible to enforce the preventive measures, and the gendarmes (military force with law enforcement duties among the civilian population) have been reported to be involved. The authorities also maintain police and local militia checkpoints across the country, but this seems to be related to the upheavals occurring during the past several months, in the lead up to and during the March 22 2020 constitutional referendum and legislative elections.

Since the decree is in place at the time of coding and I found no indication military's involvment has ended, milinv is coded as 1 in these periods.

The government increased the deployment of military and police to enforce the various restriction at the end of September 2020 (1,2,3). I did not find additional information after this suggesting that the military have stopped enforcing the measures. As such, I have coded this variable as 1 across all time periods.

 The Iranian military is in charge of much of the emergency measures in terms of planning and logistics. Furthermore, in March 2020, the military was deployed to enforce restrictions and clear public places, close down businesses etc. It is unclear how involved the military has been since then in enforcing Covid-19 regulations, but no evidence has been found showing that the military presence has been retracted, and it is thus assumed that they are still taking part in the enforcement. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 Military personnel has been deployed in Italy to help enforce emergency measures in Q2-Q3 of 2020. In the first period, military took part in enforcing the lockdown in March 2020. In July 2020, the military has also been deployed to specific quarantine centers for migrants, and enforce restrictions within these areas. However, no reports have been found of such military presence in the latter periods, whereas there continues to be reporting on military assisting in other logistics such as vaccination. It thus seems that Italy does not use the military to enforce Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 of 2020 and onward.

Note also that since the explosion in Beirut in August 2020, the military is involved in a number of tasks under that state of emergency, but I have not found any information that these operations also include enforcing any restrictions in relation to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 150 soldiers were sent by the Madagascy government to Toamasina in May 2020, to help with law and order and the enforcement of the coronavirus measures - mask wearing and social distancing.
The state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020 and reintroduced on 3 April 2021. No evidence if the military continued being involved in enforcing Covid-19 measures after Q3 of 2020. The national police is otherwise responsible for law and order in urban areas: 

''National police, under the authority of the Ministry of Public Security, are responsible for maintaining law and order in urban areas. The gendarmerie and military report to the Ministry of National Defense. The gendarmerie is responsible for maintaining law and order in rural areas at the village level, protecting government facilities, and operating a maritime police contingent. The military is also active in rural areas, particularly in maintaining order in areas affected by cattle rustling and banditry. Civilian authorities at times did not maintain effective control over the security forces. Members of the security forces committed numerous abuses.'' (1)

They have been involved in several measures related to the pandemic, but not enforcing confinement measures. The president announced that the armed forces will be responsible for distribuiting the vaccine against Covid-19.

Decrees 1604 (from 13 June 2020) and 54 (from 26 March 2021) saysthat the military can assist with emergency measures during the state of emergency in public health.  I have not found any evidence that the military's involvement in enforcing confinement measures ended during Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q2 2021.

 The measures under the state of health emergency ''include a mandatory nationwide lockdown and curfew enforced by the police and the army, requiring that citizens limit their movement during the day to absolutely necessary activities. The government has been strictly enforcing the measure by requiring individuals leaving home to acquire a special permit either from their workplace or local authorities. Since 20 March 2020, authorities have arrested thousands of individuals for violating the state of emergency or for spreading false information...'' (1) 

''The state of emergency allows, if necessary, the use of public force. Thus Morocco has deployed the police and even the army to control derogatory movements. Part of the faithful protested against the closure of the mosques.'' (2)

 During the state of emergency, the government had the prerogative of using the armed forces to enforce emergency measures (article 3). However, I did not find evidence that they were de-facto doing so. The state of public calamity does not foresee military involvement. There is brief mentions of militars getting involved in conflict, however.

 The military has been given responsibility to "oversee the quarantine of new arrivals and audit the quarantine process" as the Guardian reports (1). Consequently, the military is involved in enforcing some emergency measures.The military has also been deployed in August to work on some enforcement-related tasks such as policing quarantine hotels. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

As of 4 December 2020, the military continues to be involved in isolation and quarantie facilities and have hence continues to be coded as 1. In 2021, the situation continues.

 The military was impatient with the prime minister’s initial reluctance to impose national lockdown, and deployed troops to enforce provincial-level restrictions – forcing the government to take broader measures.

I have not found evidence suggesting that the military continues to  enforce the confinement measures. As a result, I have coded 0 for the Oct/Dec period.

The military was again deployed to 16 cities in April 2021 to help the civilian authorities enforce measures.

 Law nº 44/86 Art. 9 forsees that the government can use the armed forces during a state of emergency. During the first state of emergency, I found no evidence that the military enforced confinement measures. The second state of emergency defines that "It is the responsibility of the Armed and Security Forces to support health authorities and services, namely in conducting epidemiological inquiries, in tracing contacts and in monitoring people under active surveillance", but they have not been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures.

 President Sall ''ordered the defense and security forces to stand ready for the immediate and strict execution of the measures enacted'''. 
''Police and gendarmes are responsible for maintaining law and order. The army shares that responsibility in exceptional cases, such as during a state of emergency. Senegal was under a state of emergency from 23 March to 30 June 2020. The National Police are part of the Ministry of the Interior and operate in major cities. The Gendarmerie is part of the Ministry of Defense and primarily operates outside major cities. The army also reports to the Ministry of Defense. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over the security forces.''

The second state of emergency does not forsee military participation in enforcing the emergency measures.

 The Swiss military has been deployed to help out with Covid-19, but only in terms of logistic, health care and border control. They have not enforced any measures, and this is therefore coded 0.

 In March 2020, the army was ordered to deploy and enforce a lockdown. The lockdown ended in May 2020. After the end of the lockdown, there are no reports that the army was involved in enforcing later curfews and other restrictions. The army only continued to operate military mobile hospitals.

 The military was tasked with enforcing quarantine in Q2 2020.

According to Amnestry International Report, the military also closed a footbridge to a village: "On 18 April, the Ukrainian army closed a footbridge, the only access to the village of Staromaryivka situated in a government-controlled section of the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Two weeks previously the "Donetsk People’s Republic" had closed access to the nearest town in the territory held by armed groups. This meant that about 150 residents including disabled elderly people and children were cut off from shops, health services and emergency services. The reason given was to prevent transmission of COVID-19 although no cases had been identified in the village. Villagers were allowed to cross the bridge again from 22 April." (1)

 Since I have not found any evidence of further military's involvement in enforcing quarantine measures, therefore military involvement is coded as 0 in 2021.

 FEMA, who is in charge of managing and overseeing a lot of the national emergency, has not deployed the military or used the military to enforce any confinement measures. However, states have the opportunity to use the National Guard to enforse such measures, and some states have (See the rubric "is FEMA deploying the military?" in the source). The National Guard is not, however, the army organization responsible for external security. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, such as storms, fires, earthquakes or civil disturbances.
