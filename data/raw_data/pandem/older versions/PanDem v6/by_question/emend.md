 Covid-19 related measures, including the curfew and partial confinement of the wilayas, are still in place in Algeria in June 2021. 
The Algerian government has maintained Covid-19 measures throughout the pandemic. Τhe strictest of these measures has been the curfew / confinement of the wilayas, which has been changing and being readjusted according to epidemiological criteria. 
The latest update on the measures includes an extension of the nightly 23:59-04:00 curfew through at least 20 June 2021 across 19 provinces, including Algiers, Oran, Tebessa, and Constantine.The government has eased some other domestic measures (1).

*Comments*:
 Belgium adopted on 27 March 2020 two Special Powers Act (1, 2) which were due to expire on 30 June 2020 (3). After their expiration, the government continued updating the decrees without declaring a new Special Powers Act (see also 4). 
The government issued on 30 June 2020 a Ministerial Decree ''portant des mesures d’urgence pour limiter la propagation du Covid-19'', which was being used and continuously updated to deal with Covid-19 during Q3 of 2020. This Order had an initial limit date on 31 August 2020 (5). 

In order for the Belgian federal government to continue legislating on Covid-19 matters, the Order of 30 June 2020 (with an end date 31 August 2020) was amended by Ministrial Order of 18 October 2020, with an initial limit date of 19 November 2020 (6). 

On 28 October 2020, the Federal Governemnt issued a new Ministrial Order which replaced the Order of 18 October 2020. This Order was used and was being updated regularly up to 7 May 2021 (7; see also 4). 

In January 2021, ten months after the start of the first lockdown, the government finally introduced a ‘Pandemiewet’ (Pandemic law) (8) , to serve as a legal basis for this and all following pandemics (4). 

The Pandemic Law has not been fully introduced as of 17 May 2021. It passed its first hearing in Parliament on 7 May 2021 (9). 
The Belgian federal government continues to use the same legal instruments to deal with Covid-19  since the start of the pandemic.

 Q2 2020: 31 May 2020 corresponds to the end of the state of disaster in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the subnational entities). In the Serb Republic the state of emergency was lifted on earlier on 21 May 2020. I have not found any documents indicating the end of the state of disaster at the federal level, but it is logical to code it as having ended since it was lifted in both subnational entities. Moreover, Federal Civil Protection Headquarters has not issued any new orders for Covid-19 measures since 31 May 2020.  For example, from the OSCE report: "The Republika Srpska declared a state of emergency on the basis of Art. 70 of the Constitution as of 3 April, which ended on 21 May, while the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of natural or other disaster on 17 March, on the basis of the Framework Lawon Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH, which ended on 31 May."

*Comments*:
 The state of health alert had no limit date in its issuance. However, on 5 May 2020, the Burkinabe National Assembly passed an enabling law allowing the government to rule by Ordinance for a period of 3 months, in order to deal with the pandemic. No evidence was found on whether the government extended this enabling law, and since the curfew was lifted on 3 June 2020, it is assumed that the law did not get prolonged.

Separate measures like the curfew and quarantine have been (partly) lifted since 3 June 2020. The resumption of domestic and international flights follows the expiration of a nationwide 2100-0400 health curfew 3 June 2020. The wearing of facemasks in public remains mandatory nationwide.

 There is no national response (emlaw=6). It is not possible to provide an end date or time to the measures as the situation is dealt with on a provincial level. Hence the different provinces have ended their measures at different times.

 The state of emergency in DRC, first announced on 25 March 2020, after being prolonged several times, was lifted on 22 July 2020. This development was accompanied by a gradual easing of other restrictions (movement restrictions, businesses, schools, and international borders opening) by 15 August 2020.
After the lifting of the state of emergency, there are social distancing measures in place, and the mandatory wearing of face masks.

 Implementation of legal instrument has not ended by time of coding. The amendment that was in place from 2020-03-17-2021-03-01 has ended, but it was replaced with the permanent Epidemics Act which in terms of available measures etc. is very similar to the initial amendment. The legal instrument was thus replaced with a very similar one, and therefore this is not regarded to have ended as such.

 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Comments*:
 On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under this new law, the state of emergency and related measures have been re-declared and extended several times. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on 3 October 2020 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November 2020, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on 15 November 2020, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. 

The government has been continuously prolonging for 45 days each time the state of health emergency up until June 2021. The latest extension runs through 28 June 2021 (10).

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. This has not ended by time of coding, and is therefore left blank also for Q2 2021.

*Comments*:
 The greek government has been using art 44(1) of the Constitution as a legal instrument to pass Covid-19 legislation throughout the pandemic - from February 2020 up to June 2021. Even after the lifting of the second lockdown in 14 May 2021, the government continues to use the same legal instrument to implement other Covid-19 measures, such as the number of people allowed in public gatherings, facemasks, etc. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' - with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 - was passed by the greek government and then approved by the Parliament in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 2). The strictest measure, i.e. the first nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March 2020 (3) and lifted on 3 May 2020. The second lockdown was introduced in 7 November 2020 (4) and lifted on 14 May 2021. 
Consecutive Acts of Legislative Content and (Common) Ministerial Decisions have been issued during the pandemic. The government continues to use this legal instrument as of June 2021 (5 - 9). 

See a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 1.

 The decree that restricts fundamental rights was extended numerous times via executive decrees, always for a delimited time period [1, 2]. The last extension identified was via the Executive Decree nº PCM-050-2021, which extended the restrictions until May 9, 2021 [3]. However, there curfew measures that are still in place until June 20, 2021 [4]. This suggests that there are additional extensions that have not yet been published on the official website.

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: Decree 282/2020 from 17 June lifted the state of danger and terminated the Coronavirus Protection Act (Act XII of 2020 on the containment of coronavirus) from 30 March 2020. Was replaced by the state of epidemiological preparedness (Decree 283/2020) without an end date. The "LAW ON TRANSITIONAL RULES AND HEALTH PREPAREDNESS RELATED TO THE CESSATION OF THE STATE OF DANGER " from 17 June 2020 " introduces measures related to the revocation of the "state of danger" in Hungary. However, the law expands the powers of the government during another exceptional state, by authorizing the government to issue wide-ranging decrees without parliamentary approval during a “state of medical crisis.” During such a state, the law authorizes the government to suspend existing laws and restrict fundamental rights such as freedom of movement and assembly. The government may declare a “state of medical crisis” unilaterally, based on the recommendation of a government-appointed medical officer; the “state of medical crisis” can last up to six months and may be renewed by government decree. According to critics, the law gives the government expansive leeway to rule with minimal judicial and parliamentary scrutiny for an indefinite period." (1, ICNL) Note that the "state of medical crisis" has not been declared at the time of coding.

Q3 2020:  a state of epidemiological preparedness  was initially declared until 18 December 2020 and was extended until 18 June 2021, which has not ended at the time of coding.

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: state of danger has not ended at the time of coding. Although the second state of danger ended on 8 February 2021, a third state of danger was declared from 8 February 2021 and was extended until 22 May 2021, and further until September 2021. Since the legal instrument has been the same throughout the period, emend is left blank.

 March-June: Extended twice: on 14 April 2020 until 1 May 2020, on 29 April 2020 until 11 May 2020. The state of emergency was replaced by less strict quarantine measures, declared by the Chief State Sanitary Doctor.

July-September, October-December: after the end of the state of emergency, the same legal instrument (Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system) has been used to implement emergency measures, where the latest measures are in place at the time of coding. Therefore, the implementation of the legal instrument has not ended at the time of coding.

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1).

 The state of emergency was first declared on March 30, via the Presidential Decree nº 11/2020, and it was extended three times, until July 29. Then, President Filipe Nyus opted to declare a new state of emergency for thirty days via the Presidential Decree nº 23/2020, starting from August 8 and ending on September 6. Once it ended, it was replaced by a state of public calamity, which is still in place. Despite it, some flexibilizations were announced on 25 April 2021, e.g. opening of cinemas with 40% of the maximal capacity.

 Namibia declared a state of emergency on 17 March 2020 through the Proclamation 7/2020 (GG 7148) ''The Declaration of State of Emergency: National Disaster (COVID19)'', pursuant to Article 26(1) of the Namibian Constitution and to section 30(3) of the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2012 (Act No. 10 of 2012) [1,2]. This Proclamation was approved by the National Assembly as required by Article 26 of the Namibian Constitution on 20 March 2020, which also extended the state of emergency for 6 months [3].

After the expiration of the state of emergency on 17 September 2020, the government did not extend it further [4]. Instead, the authorities used the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015 to deal with Covid-19 regulations. The Act was brought into force on 17 September 2020 by GN 230/2020 (GG 7338). Regulations affecting movement, public gatherings, mask wearing, curfews, and alcohol sales are still being updated based on this legal instrument [5], and are currently in place through 30 June 2021 [6,7].

Note that emend is coded as 17 September 2020 for Q3 2020, because the state of emergency ended, which is the emlaw for that period. Nevertheless, emergency measures continued throughout the entire quarter under the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015.

"Tijdelijke wet maatregelen Covid-19", which was enacted on 2020-12-01, has a time limit of 3 months and can be extended through a Royal Decree. It was extended in late February, and then again in late May, and is currently set to expire on 2021-09-01.

 The state of emergency ends 7 days after the declaration of it, and the last declared state of emergency occurred at May 6, so the state of emergency thus ended at 13 may, when New Zealand began a phase of reopening.

The COVID-19 Public Health Response Act is valid for a period of 90 days. The Act was extended for another 90 days when it last expired on 4 August 2020. It was later extended until the 1 December 2020 and after for a new period of 90 days (until March 2021). In April, it was extended again for 90 days.

*Comments*:
 The government initially declared a 14-day period of emergency measures but these have been periodically extended. From 04 May the restrictions got gradually eased but curfews remained in place from 10pm-6am across all of Nigeria. On 04 September, Nigeria entered the third phase of eased lockdown which was planned to last four weeks. On 19 October, the measures were extended for four weeks and I found no evidence that they were extended further, therefore emend is coded as 16 November 2020. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control still lists limits on gatherings of over 20 people outside of workplaces; however, no other national-level restrictions from the original regulations are listed. The Nigerian CDC also issued a set of guidelines for end-of-year travel. These include mandatory testing and quarantine (7 days) for travelers entering the country, but no formal restrictions on movement or public gatherings. In January, the lockdown was extended for 4 weeks. Phase IV of lockdown was instituted on 10 May 2021 and end by the time of coding on 11 June 2021. Limitations come and go with the new developments and waves of the pandemic.

 The Executive Decree nº 507 was not revoked, but it has been altered several times. From June 1 2020, the complete lockdown was lifted and replaced with a curfew between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. during the week and a lockdown on weekends, maintaining a gender restriction that men and women could only leave their houses on alternate days (via the Executive Decree nº 644). From 14 September 2020, the curfew changed to 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and the gender restriction was lifted (via the Executive Decree nº 1078). From 25 October 2020, the lockdown on weekends was lifted, but there is still a curfew between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. (Executive Decree nº 1222). In January, there is a plan of easing the measures, however, the development of the COVID-19 pandemic maintained some measures active. On 13 January 2021, the curfew was again determined between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m., and a new gender restriction of alternate days. On 6 March 2021, the lockdown during weekends resumes, and the curfew was from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. By the time of the coding, the last updates are from 21 May 2021, when the curfew remained from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. and some restrictions to enter the country were in place.

However, on June 16 2020, it was replaced with the National Pandemic Act, which transfers most emergency powers to this law. These are still in force, and PNG had extensive Covid-19 measures during the spring of 2021.

 The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May 2020, and ended on 11 May 2020, as announced by President Putin.

 The state of emergency and the related curfew were lifted in Senegal on 30 June 2020. Air borders reopened from 15 July 2020.
The mandatory wearing of face coverings were initially declared for 3 months and has been extended once also for 3 months, until January 2021. 
On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of April 29, 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. 
The parliament enacted amendments to loi no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. As a result, in 2021,  the same legal instrument is in place, as amended, but emlaw is now most accurately coded “2“. 
The ''state of health disaster'' was nitially declared on 5 January 2021 on two regions, where a night-time curfew was also announced (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies). 

Senegal lifted the state of emergency on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures.

 No information on an end date for the state of public health emergency was found. Some emergency measures are no longer ongoing, but the state of public health emergency seems to be still in force. The constitution does not explicitly mention end dates for states of emergency. [5] The most recent update from 18 May 2021 included a closure of schools for at least one month, and a continued ban on public gatherings [6].

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1, 2 and 3) on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) based on the Constitution and the Epidemics Act of 28 September 2012. Ordinance 1, 2, 3 were later validated by the Swiss Parliament with the COVID19 Federal Act of September 25 2020.
The Swiss government continues to use the same legal instruments (Constitution and Epidemics Act) to issue COVID19 regulations. Ordinance 2 was set to expire after 6 months, but was abrogated on June 22 2020 and replaced with Ordinance 3, currently in force through December 31, 2021. Since both Ordinance 3 and the overarching Covid-19 Act is in force, this is not coded as having any end date.

Section 14 in the "Public Health (Control of COVID-19) Rules, 2020" states that "These Rules shall expire on notification by the Minister." The Public Health Act section 11 and 27 are still active and, according to the Uganda Legal Information Institute, the Public Health Rules 2020 are still in force. A state of emergency has a 90-day limit but the state of emergency has not been declared.

 On July 3 2020, The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, which relaxed some emergency measures. Between October 14 - November 4 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations was introduced, which categorized each local authority area under one of three levels of restrictions. This was revoked on November 5 and replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200), which enforced the nationwide second lockdown regulations (in effect until 1 December 2020). On 2 December the UK government replaced SI 1200 of November 5 with 2020 SI 2020/1374 which reintroduced a countrywide three-tier legal framework. These Regulations were set to expire at the end of 2nd February 2021, but was subsequently extended to 31 of march 2021. It was replaced on March 29 with the current regulation titled Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021, which is currently set to expire on 2021-06-30. As the UK still has emergency provisions in place, this does not count as it having ended.

 The Civil Protection Act, section 27:2: "The declaration of a state of disaster in terms of subsection (1) shall remain in force for a period of three months, the President may, from time to time, by statutory instrument, extend such declaration". The state of disaster has not been found to no longer be in effect, and the measures, such as lockdown, are extended for an indefinite period. Thus, it seems the state of disaster is still in effect.

While initially the statutory instruments came with specified time frames for restrictions, in May 2020, Public Health (COVID-19 Prevention, Containment and Treatment) (National Lockdown) (Amendment) Order, 2020 (No. 8) established that the restrictions would remain in place indefinitely subject to fortnightly review. The most recent amendments were made on 18 June 2021.
