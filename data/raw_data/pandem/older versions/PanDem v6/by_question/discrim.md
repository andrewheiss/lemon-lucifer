 I did not find evidence of the emergency measures discriminating "solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin".

Women are extra vulnerable as a result of the restrictions, but the restrictions themselves are not discriminatory.

*Comments*:
 There have been reports on racial profiling in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures.

''On 10 April 2020, a police chase in Molenbeek, an area of Brussels with a high number of people belonging to ethnic minority groups, resulted in the death of 19-year-old Adil Charrot who fled for fear of being fined for breach of Covid-19'' (1, 3, 5, 8) 
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May...Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7) 

A recent report (May 3 2021) by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on its findings on Belgium concludes: 
''The experts, however, were concerned about a number of issues, including police-related racial violence – reports of an increase of police violence during the Covid-19 pandemic and recent anti-racism demonstrations, persistent racial profiling and hate speech. It also addressed the situation of Roma communities and migrants.'' (9).

 No evidence of discrimination based on these rights was found. There have been incidents of excluding opposition parties but these do not fall under the grounds for discrimination of this question.
''Restrictions introduced to control the spread of Covid-19 were used to prevent political opponents from organizing meetings and rallies. 
However, demonstrations by government supporters went ahead without interference. In August 2020, the police prevented a meeting organized by Frédéric Aïvo, a political opponent, on the grounds that it was unauthorized.'' (4)

*Comments*:
 Q2  2020: Targeted discriminatory measures in Roma communities across the country, such as checkpoints and police patrols in Roma communities. According to the UN, the targeted Roma communities were Nova Zagora, Kazanlak, Sliven, Yambol, and Sofia. The measures were adopted de-jure by local councils (1, also see order 12-201/17.03.2020 from Nova Zagora, 4). Some areas (e.g. Burgas) used drones with thermal sensors for measuring temperature in quarantined Roma communities. The measures were announced at a press briefing by Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, the Head of the National Operational Headquarters (see video in 5). The lockdown measures are still in place even after the state of emergency ended, such as in Yambol (Amnesty International). Coded as 3 (Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination).

Moreover, Reuters reports that Orthodox churches were allowed to stay open during Orthodox Easter celebrations. Since the exceptions applied only for Orthodox Easter (and not e.g. Catholic Easter), it can be considered a case of minor de-facto discrimination.

Q3 2020: According to Amnestry International (3), the measures were in place from March to July 2020. According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights report (p.10, July version), the lockdown measures were extended until 8 July in Kyustendil. Since I have not been able to find evidence of extended measures in other areas, it is coded as 2 (Minor de-jure discrimination.) According to  European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights report (November version), "in September and October 2020 such measures were not applied" (2).

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: since quarantine measures had a defined limit (with the latest being 8 July 2020) and I found no evidence of further discrimination, coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 There are reports of some discrimination from law enforcement onto the Rohingyan population, who has been subject to harassment, as well as unlawful fines, when attempting to cross checkpoints that are part of the emergency measures. Similar reports are found in the second period, where Rohingyans and Rakhians have been subject to police targeting and extortion. However, no sources indicate that this is national or regional policy, or that there are any more severe or systematically imposed instances of de facto discrimination ongoing in relation to the Covid-19 emergency measures (the more severe discrimination of Rohingyans is from before the emergency measures and not part of the Covid-19 response, and thus not accounted for here). While no new reports of discrimination have been found in later periods, there has not been any evidence or indication that discrimination toward these groups have ceased or any indication that the situation has improved. This is therefore coded as 1, minor de facto discrimination, for all periods.

 There are many reports on unsanitary conditions of quarantine establishments, but no human rights violations based on these democratic rights:''The aid and medical sources said that most sites lack the necessary hygiene and sanitation infrastructure, are severely overcrowded, and raise the risk of the virus spreading unchecked.'' (1). 

''Although police and local officials have quarantined Burundians and foreigners traveling into the country by air or overland in hotels, schools, and other buildings, Burundian authorities have failed to ensure adequate food, health care, hygiene, and sanitation in some locations. Some humanitarian organizations have been blocked from reaching and providing assistance to people in quarantine.'' (1)

However, there are reports of the authorities using the pandemic to crack down on human rights: a nationwide ban on demonstrations was issued in Cameroon after the opposition Cameroon Renaissance Movement (MRC) called for the resignation of the president and hundreds of demonstrators were arbitrarily arrested (1)

 In the city of Guangzhou, the authorities targeted Africans for compulsory testing and quarantine. The government also imposed more draconian restrictions in the Xinjiang region, home to a large Uyghur population, than in other parts of the country. People in Xinjiang were physically locked into their homes, and some were handcuffed to railings on the street; detainees were forced to take traditional medicine and were sprayed with acidic disinfectant.

*Comments*:
 The 2021 HRW world report for France (6) mentions: 
''Announced changes in law enforcement and crowd control tactics fell short of addressing concerns of abusive and disproportionate use of force by the police, including during demonstrations. Discriminatory police identity checks targeting minority youth continued. Child protection authorities often failed to provide unaccompanied migrant children appropriate care and services. Migrants and asylum seekers faced inhuman and degrading living conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment. Instances of harassment and attacks remained high against minorities, including ethnic, religious, national, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) minorities.'' 
''Discriminatory police identity checks continued, including during the enforcement of Covid-19 lockdown measures. Human Rights Watch found that police target minority youth, including children as young as 12, for the stops, which often involve invasive, humiliating body pat-downs and searches of personal belongings.'' 

''In July 2020, the ECtHR ruled that France violated the rights of three asylum seekers in depriving them material and financial support to which they were entitled, forcing them to live in the streets in “inhuman and degrading living conditions.”...In Calais, NGOs providing assistance to migrants and asylum seekers reported continued harassment and abuse by police against migrants and aid workers. In September 2020, the interior minister prohibited food distribution by NGOs not authorized or contracted by the State through 14 December 2020. The French Ombudsperson said the measure constitutes “discrimination based on nationality.”

France continued to detain people in immigration detention centers during the pandemic despite calls in March 2020 from the French Ombudsperson and the General Controller for Prisons for their closure given the risks of contracting Covid-19 and the fact that deportations could not be carried out in a reasonable timeframe due to travel restrictions. In September 2020, the government announced it would use a detention center outside Paris for people who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19 while they awaited deportation.'' (6) 

'The available information suggests that the enforcement of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in France had a disproportionate impact on members of racialized groups and residents of working class
neighbourhoods.'' (1)

''in France....asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in camps were targeted with forced evictions .'' (4)

'''For example, in Nice, predominantly working class and minority ethnic neighbourhoods were subject to a longer night-time curfew than the rest of the city. The police enforcement of Covid-19-related restrictions on movement reinforced already existing discriminatory and unlawful policing trends in those neighbourhoods. In Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest department in mainland France and where most inhabitants are of North and West African origin, the number of fines for breaching confinement was three times higher than in the rest of the country. In the first day of lockdown, 10% of the fines issued were in Seine-Saint-Denis”. (1) 

''Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March 2020 to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities....In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to the physical integrity of law enforcement officials or others. '' (1) 

'Since the beginning of the lockdown, many accounts, some corroborated by videos posted on social networks, reveal police stops that appear abusive, violent, and discriminatory, sometimes accompanied by racist insults.  Available official data, as well as information published in the media, also indicate a considerable concentration of police stops to enforce lockdown measures in “quartiers populaires” – working-class neighborhoods with a high number of visible minority residents and, for example, a fine rate three times as high as the national average in Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest neighborhood of Metropolitan France. The data and accounts suggest discriminatory behavior against citizens depending on where they live and a disproportionate impact of fines on socially and economically disadvantaged households, the organizations said.''

 According to a report by Amnestry International (1, p.6): "Contrary to medical advice, religious gatherings have not been restricted  by law largely to ensure that the Georgian Orthodox Church could conduct liturgies for Orthodox Easter. During Palm Sunday and Easter celebrations on 12 April and 19 April in Georgia, several Orthodox churches hosted dozens of worshippers. All other religious groups in Georgia have voluntarily agreed to close their places of worship to the public. On 15 April, the head of the muslim community of Georgia, Mirtaghi Asadov, declared that when Ramadan begins, they will also open mosques and expect that the government will treat them with the same understanding as they have shown to the Orthodox church. Two days after this statement, Mirtaghi Asadov was summoned for questioning to the State Security Service of Georgia in connection with an attempt to “sabotage” the state." Since both Easter and Ramadan took place in the first time period (Q2 2020), discrim is coded as 0 in Q3 2020. No information on discrimination found in Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

 One person was denied access to treatment due to their mental health status, and covid-19 survivors are stigmatized in society. However, no emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated "solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin" were found.

*Comments*:
 The Greek government, alongside the nationwide lockdown it imposed to deal with the pandemic in March 2020, it also imposed movement restrictions of asylum-seekers in refugee camps in the Aegean islands in April 2020 and extended it continuously, without any virological basis, i.e. without any Covid-19 case having been found (2). The first Covid-19 case in Moria camp in Lesvos was reported in early September 2020. (7) 

During Q2 of 2020, after the lifting of the the nationwide lockdown on 4 May 2020, the government announced that the island camps will continue to be closed until May 2020 and then June 2020 without offering an explanation on its decision. (1, 4, 5, 6).

During Q3 of 2020, after the first Covid-19 case was found in Moria in September 2020 (7) , the Greek authorities extended the lockdown of all structures hosting refugees and migrants until 15 September 2020. (8)

In Q4 of 2020, many refugee camps continued being under lockdown, but this time because Covid-19 cases were found. Some other camps however stopped being under quarantine after Covid-19 was under control (e.g. Malakasa camp on 12 October 2020), while other like the VIAL camp in Chios, is in quarantine due to coronavirus infections since 14 October 2020, last extended through 4 November 2020 (see 9, 10). 

Nevertheless, the greek government decided in November 2020 to continue controlling movement in all camps, and the police controls entry and exit: ''The Greek Government announced the control of movement until further notice in almost all the camps.'' (11).

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have not reported any discrimination within the response to Covid-19, and no other indications of such discrimination has been found. Important to note is that on April 30 2021, Hong Kong introduced some discriminatory measures toward migrant workers. They have been targeted by authorities as being of “high risk” to spread the virus due to their habit of “mingling” with other migrant workers. As a result, the government has ordered the migrant worker group to be mandatorily tested, as well as requiring them to get vaccinated or – if not wanting to get vaccinated – leave the country. Neither testing nor such vaccination policies has been directed to any other group of the population, and NY Times reports that there is no basis in these measures in terms of the extent of viral spread among migrant workers compared to other social groups. The requirement of vaccinations was whitdrawn a couple days later due to protests from parts of the population and officials from other countries, but the testing requirement remained and continues even though the first round of such testing showed a very low level of infections. This, however, is not regarded as discrimination within this coding as it does not affect migrant groups democratic rights such as movement, assembly etc. differently than other people in Hong Kong. Thus, this is coded as 0 for all time periods, although discrimination outside of the scope here considered has been going on.

*Comments*:
 The Hungarian Helsinki Committee argues that the measures used to expel Iranian students for violating the quarantine are discriminatory, but I have not found further confirmation of this in other sources. The authorities also suspended the admissions of refugees into the transit zone due to covid-19 concerns (most migrants coming from or transiting through Iran), although Human Rights Watch argues that most of them had been at the other side of the border for more than a year. Coded as 0 since the measures apply to people outside the country. Additional note: Hungarian parliament also passed a law prohibiting transgender or intersex people to change their gender, but this is not part of emergency measures (1). No new information found in July-September, October-December.

*Comments*:
 Muslims in India have been routinely faced discrimination with regards to the emergency measures. 

1: A hospital in Ahmedabad segregated Covid-19 patients based on their religion, claiming the order came from the government. Hindu and Muslim Covid-19 patients were warded in the hospital separately.

2: A BJP leader in Uttar Pradesh has urged people against buying vegetables from Muslim vendors claiming that vegetables sold by them had been infected with the virus.

I have not found evidence suggesting that the situation with Muslims being discriminated against has improved. Hence I have continued to code this variable as 1.

*Comments*:
 There are numerous reports of Israel’s policies on the Gaza Strip and West Bank leave Palestinians more exposed to Covid-19, and with less access to health care. Especially, the imposed travel ban on Palestinian territory by the Israeli government has caused concern of numerous Palestinians not being able to access sufficient health care if Covid-19 starts spreading widely. However, the policies toward these territories and the people living there are not related to the Covid-19 crisis, and have been in place long before that. Furthermore, no evidence has been found that the Israeli government has imposed any other regulations that restrict any democratic freedoms more for some groups. Thus, to the extent that Israeli policies actively discriminate Palestinians or other groups democratic rights, these have been in place before the crisis and are not related to the emergency response. Also noteworthy is that some Ultra-Orthodox representatives in Israel have argued that they are subject to discrimination from the governments Covid-19 policy as some areas where these communities live and operate have been targeted with heavy restrictions that also limit their capacity to practice their faith, but this has according to officials been entirely motivated by the significant spread of Covid-19 in these communities and their lack of measures to contain it themselves. This also seems  correct, and is thus not regarded as discrimination, as the Israeli policy has been to try and contain the spread in areas where it has spread most intensely with specific measures. This is therefore coded as 0. Israel has also been criticized for not granting vaccinations to Palestinians while introducing mass vaccination to the Israeli citizens. However, this does not infringe on democratic rights as such and is therefore not accounted for here.

Note that Jordan has been criticized for imposing extensive Covid-19 restrictions without providing aid toward more vulnerable groups who are more affected by these restrictions. However, the restrictions themselves have not been imposed differently across groups and this therefore doesn’t constitute discrimination.

 Kenyan authorities have been accused of abusively and by force putting people with Covid-19 symptoms in quarantine in facilities that lacked proper sanitation, were crowded and confined, and did not provide people with personal protective equipment like face masks. 
However, there was no evidence of discrimination found on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin.

*Comments*:
 The Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing de facto discrimination against non-Kuwaiti nationals, despite some government action to try to redress migrant labour issues (particularly undocumented workers) and xenophobia. Some government lockdown measures were applied to neighbourhoods where many migrant workers live (there were cases of Covid-19 here so not coded), and the government has announced that as a result of the pandemic and associated economic crisis it will seek to reduce migrant labour numbers in future. This has contributed to an environment of discrimination against migrant labourers, including Kuwait MPs and journalists on state-owned media networks calling for deportation of migrants or restrictions on migrants to free up resources for nationals. Existing discrimination against migrant workers and the state’s unwillingness to hold Kuwaiti employers to account, for example over the non-payment of salaries, has resulted in a number of protests among migrant labourers, quelled by Kuwaiti security forces. This is regarded as a minor de facto discrimination, and therefore coded as 1. There are not as much reporting on this found in the latter periods, but nothing has been found that indicates any improvements, and this is thus coded as 1 for latter periods as well.
Note that in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, it was reported that Kuwaiti authorities have sidestepped migrant workers in their vaccination program, vaccinating all citizens of Kuwait before vaccinating any migrant workers who make up 70% of the population (so that teenagers with citizenship are prioritized over aged migrant workers, for instance). This is not accounted for here, however, as it does not regard democratic rights such as freedom of movement and assembly.

*Comments*:
 Syrian refugees have been subject to discriminatory restrictions by several local authorities in Lebanon. In March and April 2020, it has been reported that Syrian refugees were given significant restrictions on movement even before the entrance of the lockdown in Beirut, and that these restrictions included much harsher restrictions than those of the lockdown. Most prominently, Syrian refugees were only allowed to move outside there home four hours per day, much less than Lebanese citizens were allowed. It has been difficult to confirm that this is on going, but several large organizations on human rights situations such as Human Rights Watch, US State Department reports on Human Rights, and UNHCR have reported on it and none of them have provided any indication that this has stopped. UNHCR for instance highlight it in their report on rights violations in Lebanon toward refugees during the whole of 2020, without any mention that the situation has improved. This is therefore assumed to be continuing. Note also that Syrian refugees (as well as other groups of refugees) are facing other discriminating treatment, such as not getting vaccines, and are also reported to be subject to torture and abusive enforcement from Lebanese authorities over the past years (these actions, however, are not related to Covid-19 measures in any way).

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and BBC report that the Malaysian government has detained migrants during Covid-19, including children, arguing that this was necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Law enforcement rounded up and arrested hundreds of migrants in Kuala Lumpur, and placed in detention camps. A Bangladeshi migrant who criticized these actions by the government on TV was also prosecuted for speaking up on the the issue. This is therefore coded as 3, major de facto discrimination. No evidence has been found that this practice has stopped, or that the situation has improved, and the more general discrimination toward migrants and refugees in Malaysia seem to be on-going.

There is evidence that the authorities have continued to detain migrants in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. This is therefore coded 3 across all the time periods.

However, this appears to be an isolated incident and does not fall under the categories of discrimination listed in the ICCPR.

 The government established a gender quarantine. Women could go out on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; men could go out on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The dates did not change while the measure was in place, so women were not allowed to leave their houses on weekends. Additionally, this measure received criticism for enhancing discrimination against the transgender community. The measure was lifted on 14 September 2020 and resumed again in December 2020. In January-March 2021 discrim is coded as 2 due to evidence of a continuation of the practice. On 8 February, some gender restrictions were lifted. In April-June 2021, it is coded as 0, since there is no evidence that the measure has been applied.

However, the measures currently in place give rise to opportunities to enhance discrimination which have already been in place prior to the pandemic.

1: On April 5, volunteers in the village of Pandacaqui, in Pampanga province stopped and detained three LGBT people outside after curfew, two of whom explained they were running an errand for their grandmother. A village official accused them of looking for illicit sex and, as punishment, publicly humiliated them by ordering them to kiss, dance and do push ups on live video broadcast on social media. 

2: There have been reports of acts of racism committed against the Chinese community in the Philippines. For example, Adamson University in Manila ordered all of its Chinese students to quarantine themselves during the outbreak regardless of their travel history in February 2020.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, migrants workers from Nepal were placed in detention centers and then deported after being approached by the police who said that they were going to get tested for Covid-19 (detained on 12 and 13 March 2020, deported on 15 and 19 March 2020). The government responded that they were detained because of engagement in illegal and illicit activity, which Amnesty International says there is no evidence for (based on interviews and documents given to migrants). Since the government denies the measures, this is coded as major de-facto discrimination. The Doha Industrial Area, the largest migrant camp in Qatar, was placed in total lockdown after cases of Covid-19 were discovered there, which is not coded since the measures may have been due to public health reasons. There are numerous reports of horrific conditions in the migrant camps (e.g. lack of access to water and poor sanitation), which were exacerbated by the pandemic but are not considered in the coding since the conditions already existed before the lockdown.  However, as the deportations also occurred in Q2 and there’s no evidence of any continuation of these measures, this is coded as 3 only for Q2.
For the latter periods, no evidence of any discrimination in the Covid-19 measures has been found from sources such as the US state department, Amnesty and Human Rights Watch. After Q2 of 2020, this is therefore coded 0.

*Comments*:
 While existing discrimination against Roma likely was exacerbated due to covid-19, I have not found any de-facto or de-jure discriminatory emergency measures. Romania placed areas with a large number of Covid-19 cases under lockdown, which included some Roma communities. Such measures are not coded as discrimination because they were based on the number of Covid-19 cases. There was additional police deployment to areas with large Roma populations (Amnesty International report, p. 25), but, according to the authorities, it was due to high risk of criminality and therefore not coded.

*Comments*:
 The Saudi government has taken several discriminating actions toward migrant workers as part of their emergency response. For example, during April 2020 they deported thousands of Ethiopian migrant workers during the pandemic, and as the UN reports the government argued that "Ethiopians were vulnerable to the coronavirus and they have deported some with symptoms and many without, but no testing." Consequently, the government have deported these migrant workers not because the individuals have shown infection of Covid-19, but for being part of that group. Newspaper investigations also show that since those deportations caused international critique, Saudi Arabia has been keeping an unknown but large number of migrant workers in detention centers with horrible standards and under immediate risk of spreading both Covid-19 and other diseases, as well as being subject to extensive violence from guards at the centers. Saudi Arabia faced massive criticism from this, for example by the European Parliament, and eventually started repatriating migrants from these centers to Ethiopia in late January 2021. However, far from all had been repatriated at that time, and no evidence has been found that all have now been repatriated and that these Covid-19 detention centers are no longer in force. Thus, lacking confirmation that this has entirely ended by time of Q2 of 2021 (or time of coding), this is coded 3 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 Housing centers for refugees, migrant and asylum-seekers were placed under 24-hour quarantine. The residents were not allowed to leave the centers, except for getting medical care. According to the Amnesty International report, “the authorities imposed a special regime, selectively targeting government operated centres housing refugees, migrants, and asylum-seekers, placing them under a strict 24-hour mandatory quarantine and deploying the military to monitor the curfew”.  (1) Based on information from August, there were no Covid-19 cases in the housing centers.

De-jure, the measures for housing centers applied for the duration of the state of emergency (BBC) and, after the state of emergency ended, were reintroduced from 7 May 2020, and were repealed from 15 May 2020 (Službeni glasnik RS", broj 66 and broj 74). Nevertheless, there is evidence that the restrictions on movement continued. According to Amnesty International, "On 17 May, the authorities deployed the armed forces to guard camps in Sid, arguing that this was necessary to manage the security situation and to protect citizens from petty crime and harassment, although no increase of such incidents was recorded in the town." (1) A BBC article from 27 November says that while there are no restrictive measures de-jure, de-facto there are restrictions on movement, such as requirements to get permits to be able to leave the centers and 14-day quarantine for new arrivals.  (2) Since I found no information on  discrimination against refugees, migrants and asylum-seeks in 2021, discrim is coded as 0 in Q1 2021, Q2 2021. This does not mean it has not continued in practice.

*Comments*:
 No evidence of discriminatory measures found. Migrant workers who often live in crowded and unhygienic conditions were disproportionately affected by Covid-19. After a spike in cases that amounted to over 90% of all cases in the country, Singapore implemented strict lockdown procedures in the workers' quarters that exceeded other areas. However, because this was prompted by cases of Covid-19, we do not code this as discriminatory.

*Comments*:
 Mandatory targeted testing and quarantine for Roma communities approved by government resolution 196/2020 that is considered discriminatory since it applies only to the Roma and not other communities or areas. Five Roma settlements were placed under quarantine by the military. According to European Union Agency for Fundamental Human Rights, "The lockdown of localities lasted until 15th May (some of the localities were opened earlier), with the town of Žehra being fully reopened as the last." (1) Therefore, discrim is coded as 3 (major de-jure discrimination) only in March-June period.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have led to discrimination against the Muslim community.

1: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection (1). 

2: Muslims who have died from Covid-19 have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families and Muslim tradition. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations. A petition against the cremation rule was accepted by the country’s Supreme court and began hearing the case on 13 July 2020 (1,3,4,5).

The anti-cremation order was lifted in February 2021. However bodies are now only allowed to be buried on a remote island 300km away from the capital, Colombo. There is no scientific justification for these actions (8,9).

*Comments*:
 There has been multiple incidences of the Thai authorities discriminating against migrant workers in Thailand. In December 2020, a Covid-19 cluster was found in a Shrimp Market and dormitory in Samut Sakhon. Migrant workers were then prohibited from leaving their dormitories. Migrant workers were also prohbited from entering or leaving the Samut Sakhon province. However, Thai citizens did not face these restrictions. Migrant workers were also banned from visiting religious sites during this time while Thai citizens again did not face these restrictions (1,2,3,4).

This travel ban continued during the stricter lockdown in January 2021. Here Thai citizens were allowed to travel between provinces only for essential purposes. However migrant workers were banned from travelling altogether (5). As these restrictions are still in place, I have coded this variable as 1 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 No discrimination solely based on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin, was found in the emergency response to the pandemic.
In February 2021, Human Rights Watch denounced that "Tunisian security forces have repeatedly targeted protesters, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) activists at protests, Human Rights Watch said today. The targeting involved arbitrary arrests, physical assaults, threats to rape and kill, and refusing access to legal counsel. The recent accounts of abuse were provided against the backdrop of increased persecution of LGBTI people during the Covid-19 pandemic in Tunisia, where homosexuality is criminalized, and an intensified crackdown on LGBTI organizing in recent years."

 In 2020, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported more than 100 cases of discrimination in the enforcement of Covid-19 protocols that targeted LGBTI communities in Uganda [1]. In March 2020, the police raided a shelter for LGBTI persons, arresting and detaining them without access to representation or due process. In May 2020, all charges were dropped and the individuals were released after filing a law suit. Later, they filed suit against the prison and mayor claiming to have experienced torture and inhuman treatment while in custody. According to the U.S. Department of State Human Rights Report for 2020, on July 19 2020, local government authorities in Kyenjojo Town disrupted a meeting of LGBTI persons claiming that it violated Covid-19 rules [2]. We further evidence of such discrimination ongoing in 2021, including the arrest of 44 LGBT people in June 2021 for unlawful gathering, supposedly under the Covid-19 restrictions. The arrests included forced anal examinations, and police leaked video footage, outing these individuals. [5] There is a history of outed LGBT persons being violently attacked in Uganda, including the 2011 murder of David Kato.

 In May 2020, , the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk verbally ordered the Roma to be expelled from the city for violating Covid-19 measures. Ten Roma were expelled from the city by force. Criminal proceedings for discriminations were launched against the major, and he later apologized. In June 2020, an event organized by the LGBTI community was dispersed due to alleged violations of quarantine restrictions, despite being previously approved by the authorities as well as compliance with quarantine requirements.

*Comments*:
 It has been reported that people of color in England and Wales were disproportionately fined by police forces for breaking lockdown rules in 2020. This has rendered debate in 2021, and MPs have argued for the fines to be revoked and the system changed in order to be lawful and not discriminatory. It is unclear to what extent the discrimination has continued during the coded period, but no evidence has been found suggesting that the discriminatory fining of some minorities has ceased, and this is therefore coded 1 for all periods. 
There has also been much debate and criticism about the adverse effect of the pandemic and the restrictions in UK on different minorities and women, but these are not the result of active discrimination within the measures adopted, and thus not accounted for here.

“In May [2020], Minister of Home Affairs, Kampyongo, ordered entry and exit restrictions at refugee settlements as a Covid-19 mitigation measure. UNHCR reported that following the minister’s announcement, authorities restricted the movement of refugees by limiting the issuance of mobility passes.”, the 2020 report on Human Rights Practices in Zambia, from the U.S. Department of State, reads (1).
However, the Statutory Instrument adopted by the Ministry of Health states: "A person shall not enter or leave an infected area without - (a) the permission of an authorized officer..." (2). So, only if medical officials declared refugee camps to be "infected areas" when they were in fact not, then the restrictions on issuing passes for movement would be considered discrimination in this coding. No evidence have been found that the medical officials wrongly claimed the camps to be infected, and so this is not included in the score for this variable.
