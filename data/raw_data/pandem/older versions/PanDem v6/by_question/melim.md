*Comments*:
 The newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria approved a bill in April 2020 amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.'' (see 1, 3, 4, 6). 

LAW 20-06 AMENDING THE PENAL CODE (2) - The amendments increase prison sentences for defamation, and introduce new penalties including prison sentences for the dissemination of false information. Under the amendments, new offenders face prison sentences of between one and three years. In addition, penalties are heightened if the offence takes place “at a time of a public health lockdown or a natural, biological or technological catastrophe or any other form of catastrophe,” with first time offenders facing up to five years in prison.

The law has received widespread criticism by free speech activists, who point out that it could be used to curb independent reporting of the government’s failings in tackling the pandemic. These deficiencies, such as the lack of adequate preventative measures in hospitals, have prompted some doctors to post videos on social media in which they draw attention to the difficult circumstances they are working under. The new law could be used to suppress such reports.'' (5)

*Comments*:
 March-June: Decree on the state of emergency obliged media outlets to refer only to official government sources on covid-19 (Decree 298). The measures were amended on 24 March (Decree 345) where some provisions were removed but the measures still required media outlets to reflect the government's position. The measures applied until 13 April when the state of emergency (but not the media measures) was extended. The Minister of Justice issued a statement that the measures might be restored, which did not happen (the state of emergency ended on 11 September). Melim is therefore coded as 3 in the March-June period.

July-September 2020, October 2020 - June 2021: no measures limiting media freedom found.

*Comments*:
 According to OSCE report, Azerbaijan is among the countries that "have introduced and/or applied provisions to criminalize the dissemination of so-called “false information” or “false news” about the pandemic (1). According to a report by the Law Library of Congress, these are Laws Nos. 27-VIQD, 28-VIQD, and 30-VIQD from 17 March. For example, "Law No. 28-VIQD amends the Criminal Code (CC) by adding article 139-1, which criminalizes “[a] violation of the anti-epidemic, sanitary-hygienic, and quarantine regimes that causes, or creates a substantial threat of, the spread of disease." (2) Since this legislation is not part of emergency measures but rather amendments to permanent legislation, it is not coded under melim.

Under existing legislation (The 2008 Media Law of Belarus), media outlets that public false information can get their license revoked or be blocked, which was used to threated a media outlet for publishing a story about the dealth of a Covid-19 patient in April 2020. Since it is existing legislation, it is not considered in the coding.

*Comments*:
 The Decree nº 4200 Article 13 states that "People who incite non-compliance with this Supreme Decree or misinform or generate uncertainty for the population, will be subject to criminal charges for the commission of crimes against public health" [1]. On May 7, 2020, it was altered via Decree nº 4231 to "People who incite non-compliance with this Supreme Decree or disseminate information of any kind, whether in written, printed, artistic and/or by any other procedure that endangers or affects public health, generating uncertainty in the population, will be liable to complaints for the commission of crimes typified in the Penal Code" [2]. The vague formulation of the measure allowed for not only stopping disinformation, but also limiting any type of reporting [3]. Amnesty International, HRW and Civicus argued that this measure threatened freedom of expression [4, 5, 6]. There is no evidence that it was used to limit media freedom, but there are accusations that it was used to persecue political adversaries [6]. Due to public pressure, on May 14, 2020, the Decree nº 4236 repealed the provisions [7].

These restriction means that media outlets would only have 2 sources to look into and use when reporting on the nature of the Covid-19 virus."

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures do not place de jure limitations on media, but Myanmar has previous de jure limitations on media that has been used to restrict reporting on Covid-19. Article 505 of the Penal Code states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is illegal and can result in prison up to two years. This penal code has been in continued use since the coup, with several journalists being put on “wanted lists”. This, however, is not a part of the emergency response and was in place before the Covid-19 crisis, and no sources state that Myanmar has introduced any new de jure limitations since then, so this is coded as 0 for all three periods.

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures that have been in place since 2017 do restrict media freedom in multiple ways. The restrictions include 
1: Requiring online newspapers to register for permits to continue publishing.
2: Requiring media outlets to deposit sums (depending on the type of media) to bank accounts. The sums are high and act as deterrents to independent outlets.
3: The Supreme Council for Media Regulation has the power to block or suspend personal accounts if it decides that they are publishing or broadcasting fake news.
4: Recently, the authorities have also warned that those who spread "false news" about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines.

Reporters without borders criticize that "the definition of misinformation is so broad that it gives the authorities the discretionary power to declare any piece of information false"

*Comments*:
 No de jure media limitations. 
The bill called “Global Security Law” presented in the past fall, and in particular its article 24, represented a concerning development. The provision would have penalized any “malicious” dissemination of images of
members of the security forces. This would have prevented journalists and others from filming the police in their interventions and may hamper the exposure of police violence. Following strenuous opposition and protests, the government dropped this provision as a way to “save” the law. (2)

 No de jure media limitations were found in the emergency measures. However, government initially had not granted journalists an exemption from the curfew restrictions: 
''In a decree dated 21 May 2020, the government rectified the situation by restoring the right of press workers who "are part of the professional categories that can move freely during curfew hours, as is the case for doctors, for example.''

 President Jokowi's government established a regulation that empowers the police to prosecute acts defaming the President's or government officials' ability to handle Covid-19. Journalists who do this could be imprisoned for up to 18 months. This has been in place since 4 April 2020. (2,3)

“The Indonesian National Police Headquarters (Mabes Polri) has officially issued a telegram containing law-enforcement guidelines in handling criminal activities amidst the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. The official telegram was signed by Head of the Criminal Investigation Agency, Comm. Gen. Listyo Sigit Prabowo on April 4 [2020].   The three main violations that police’s cyber patrol will monitor include the spread of coronavirus-related hoaxes, anti-government and anti-president smears, and online frauds regarding the sales of health equipment.” (1)

*Comments*:
 In March of 2020, “the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance ordered media and journalists to use only official sources and statistics in their reporting” (2). In practice, this means that the Iranian government has called for a full control of the reporting on Covid-19, and as this comes directly from the Ministry of Culture it is regarded as a de jure limitation. This is therefore coded as 3. No indication has been found that this has been revoked, and Iran also issued a ban on reporting on vaccines in a way not concurring with the government's own information and message. 
Reporters without borders also report that: "The Covid-19 National Management Office (the government body set up to combat the coronavirus) and the press department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance have issued a communiqué announcing that "no newspapers will be printed until further notice." (1) Officially, this is to ensure respect for the government's social distancing measures, because 'the distribution of printed newspapers and magazines requires physical interaction between individuals, journalists, printers and distributers, and this interaction could potentially facilitate the spread of the virus.'".(1).  This is thus a part of the national emergency response, and a de jure limitation on the media by banning all printed media, in addition to the more major limitation noted above.

 Jordans government issued a decree in April 2020 under the state of emergency that states that spreading ”rumours, fabrications and false news that sows panic” about the pandemic is punishable with up to three years in prison. Furthermore, it has no declared end date as has been found, and as far as have been seen it is still in effect (as is the state of emergency). As part of the emergency measures, the government has also suspended all printed media as they argue it would increase the spread of the virus. No indication has been found that either of these have been removed, and this is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

 Coded as 0 since there are no national-level measures that limit media freedom. According to the decision to declare a state of emergency in certain areas (from 25 March until 10 May), the authorities can control media outlets to prevent the escalation of the situation. These measures are not considered in the coding since they do not apply to the whole country.

The authorities also submitted a draft bill on false information, which was adopted by the parliament but not accepted yet by the president; the law has been retured to parliament by the president on 3 August for further legislative work.

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11). Consequently, the decree makes it punishable to report in any way on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes. Furthermore, it regulates which media outlets shall report on the Covid-19 situation and government response. This is therefore coded as 3 - the emergency measure de jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the governments position. No evidence has been found that this regulation having been repealed or amended.

*Comments*:
 On April 29 2020, Liberia's solicitor general said that the government would shut down news outlets and seize equipment from journalists alleged to have disseminated fake news. Also, media are forced to suspend printing due to lockdown restrictions, thus limiting their reach. Also, the Liberian constitution, article 15a: "Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression ... save during an emergency declared" Article 86a: "...the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees..." But the measures themselves have been argued to explicitly target fake news and violations of lockdown.
However, these actions were taken under the state of emergency, which ended on 2020-07-21. No evidence of these measures having been enforced after that, nor that it was replaced with any other de jure limitations to media. This is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 of 2020.

 The text of the Law  n ° 91-011 of 18 July 1991 (1)  relating to exceptional situations, mentions:
Art. 17 - The proclamation of the emergency situation automatically confers on the President of the Republic the power, by regulatory means:
                6. To take all measures to ensure the control of the press of publications and broadcasts of all kinds and to prohibit those which are likely to disturb public order or endanger national unity;

The Decree N ° 2020 –359 of 21 March 2020 proclaiming a state of health emergency (2), mentions:
Article 4.- The Minister of National Defense...... the Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Development, the Minister of Communication and Culture,......are each responsible as far as he is concerned, of the execution of this decree.

''...the Malagasy authorities have taken some of the most restrictive measures for the media in Africa. Radio stations and television channels are obliged to broadcast official information on the coronavirus, under penalty of sanction. This directive should not be subject to any restriction on the information that the media may publish according to the Minister of Communication. Free-to-air programs giving voice to listeners were also banned as part of the state of health emergency.'' (3) 

The Madagascan authorities, responding to accusations of restricting media freedoms (see more on this on the following media variables), said:
"The press is one of the services that are automatically requisitioned" (3) 

According to the Minister of Communication Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy: "There is absolutely no restriction of their freedom of expression per se, but - it is true and we assume it, because that is the law which authorizes and which says it - the press is part of the services that are requisitioned as part of a state of emergency . So we ask all the media in Madagascar to disseminate information on everything related to the coronavirus without asking them for any restriction in the information they can publish." (3) 

The state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020, therefore also the media limitations based on it. 

The state of emergency was reinstated on 3 April 2021, and the Decree N°2021-390 includes the same provision regarding the media being requisitioned as the first state of health emergency (see article 4 of said decree, 5).

''On 18 December 2020, the transition government declared a state of emergency related to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a letter sent from the Ministry of Territorial Administration to regional and local authorities, this state of emergency granted authorities the power to take “all necessary measures” to control the press, social media, and all nature of publications, including radio and television broadcasts.'' (1) 

''Malian journalists are protesting orders by the transitional administration that they see as suppressing freedom of the press in the West African country.In a protest meeting of media workers on 20 December 2020, the Union of Free Radio and Television (URTEL) rejected these measures, stressing that "in the name of the fight against the coronavirus disease, we will never accept from anyone the questioning of essential freedoms, including freedom of the press".'' (2). 
''In a statement, the Malian Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, explained that "contrary to some interpretations in the media, the instruction of 18 December 2020 is only an update of an instruction dating from 2015 declaring a state of emergency on the national territory".'' (2, 3). 

The state of emergency is still in place until 26 June 2021.

 Q 2020: Media outlets are obliged to only use information on covid-19 from the competent public authorities in order to limit disinformation. IPI reports that the decree orders "all media not to print or broadcast any “personal opinions” about COVID-19 during the state of emergency." (1) According to ICNL, "During the state of emergency, all audiovisual media providers under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Moldova are required to present the official position of the competent public authorities (World Health Organization, Exceptional Situation Commission of the Republic of Moldova, the Government of the Republic of Moldova, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection). All presenters, moderators, and editors must not express their own opinion on topics concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure "maximum accuracy and correctness."  (2)

Q3 2020, Q1 2020: no measures limiting media freedom found.

Q4 2020: Media outlets were recommended to inform the population on emergency measures (Resolution 33 from 28 September). Since it is a recommendation, it is not coded under melim.

Q2 2021:  Resolution 11/66 from 19 March 2021 issued recommendations on stopping disinformation to media outlets. Since it is a recommendation, it is not coded under melim.

 On April 29, Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: ”Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 000 togrogs for a person or 5 000 000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable” (Section 5.13.1). Note that 500 000 togrogs is approximately 185 american dollars, and 5 000 000 togrogs aprooximately 1850 american dollars. As the current pandemic is regarded such a case of crisis, a person can be punished with fines if "disseminating false information" on the crisis. However, no other de jure limitations on media have been found in Mongolias emergency response. Therefore, this is coded as 1 - a de jure limitation on media restricted to making some limitations on the reporting on Covid-19.
No evidence has been found that this law has been abrogated or amended during the second an third period, and the law text is still in place on the Mongolian law website (https://www.legalinfo.mn/law/details/12695). This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 With the Decree No. 2-20-292 of 23 March 2020 (1, 2) on special provisions for a State of Health Emergency, the government is enabled to ... take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).'' (3)

Also, in a statement on 22 March 2020, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news (see 5 in arabic). The Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions starting on 26 May 2020 (6). 

In addition, on 19 March 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on 27 April 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on 4 May 2020 (4). 

According to the US Department of State's 2020 report on human rights (7), ''On 23 March 2020, parliament passed a law declaring a health emergency and setting a penalty of a three-month prison sentence for anyone disobeying “orders and decisions taken by public authorities” and for anyone “obstructing” through “writings, publications or photos” those decisions. As of May 2020, 91, a total of 623 individuals were briefly detained or fined for breaking the new state of emergency law, of whom 558 remained in detention. 
On 28 March 2020, the secretary general of the Presidency of the Public Prosecutor’s Office reported that police had arrested 56 individuals for publishing false information regarding Covid-19.''

 Amendments to the emergency regulations made on 17 April 2020 included provisions against false reporting. "A person commits an offense if that person - (e) publishes, through any form of media, including social media - (i) any false or misleading statement about or in connection with Covid-19; (ii) any statement that is intended to deceive any other person about the Covid-19 status of any person or measures to combat, prevent, and suppress Covid-19 as specified in and under these regulations" [1].  This provision was also included in the measures taken after September 17 2020 [2], including the most recent provisions adopted on 30 April and extended through 30 June 2021 [3].

 Neither Reporters Without Borders nor the International Press Institute report any de jure limitations on media having been imposed during the pandemic, and there is no indication of any such de jure limitations in the Norwegian Governments response to Covid-19. Note that there has been debate regarding Norway during Q1 and Q2 of 2021 not exempting journalists from the mandatory quarantine of 10 days when entering the country, which in practice limits international journalists covering news in Norway. However, as this does not influence the reporting on media and journalists based in Norway, this is not accounted for.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures did initially not include any de jure limitation on the media. However, after the implementation of a new emergency law, the National Pandemic Act, on June 16 2020, some de jure limitations were imposed. The Law states under Section 47 that ”A person commits an offense if the person … knowingly gives false or misleading information, or … recklessly disseminates false or misleading information to the public in relation to a Public Health Emergency”. Being found guilty of any of the offenses under Section 47 (which includes other offenses as well) can result in penalties of fines up to 50 000 Kina, and imprisonment for up to five years. 
This is a direct limitation of media reporting on Covid-19, as it bans ”false and misleading information”, but since this is vaguely formulated, this could very well be used to prosecute reporting on Covid-19 more generally. This is coded 2, as it limits media reporting to a large extent, but does not control it completely.

 No measures limiting media freedom found. Qatar amended it’s penal code in in January in 2020, which further restricts the already severely limited freedom of speech and media freedom. It involves, for instance, up to five years of prison for spreading “fake news”, which is not elaborated in the law what that constitutes. However, this amendment and other laws in use to limit free speech and media is not related to the Covid-19 measures, and were in place before the pandemic. This is therefore coded 0, as no de jure limitation of limiting media freedom in relation to the Covid-19 response was found.

*Comments*:
 Based on amendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code from 31 March 2020 (100-FZ), dissemination of false information"can be punished with a fine or jail sentence, which IPI argues is a fake news law that can be used to limit freedom of the media. (1) According to the Council of Europe, "Media organisations will face fines of up to 5 million rubles (€62,000), that may rise up to 10 million rubles (€124,000) for repeated offences. Individuals will face criminal prosecution that may lead to severe financial penalties (e.g. fines equivalent to the person’s total income over the last 18 months) and prison sentences for up to 5 years." (2)

Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, Art 207 mentions that it is applicable towards information regarding events that threaten security and safety of citizens, which includes epidemics. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

 According to regulations governing the implementation of response to the national state of disaster published by the government Gazette on 29 April 2020 (No. R480), "Any person who publishes any statement, through any medium, including social media, with the intention to deceive any other person about - (a) Covid-19; (b) Covid-19 infection status of any person; or (c) any measure taken by the Government to address Covid-19" (Article 14) is liable to conviction of fine or six months imprisonment [1]. The government has set up measures to actively track scammers and fake news online regarding the pandemic. This is why it was coded 1 instead of 2.

 While there hasn't been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals for spreading false informationabout COVID-19. None of these people were journalists (1,2).

 Lockdown restrictions have stopped printing, making content available only online, meaning that most Sudanese will not have access to them as internet penetration is low. This however, does not allow the government to de-jure control the content of the media. No de-jure limitations of media freedom as part of the Covid-19 emergency measures was found.

*Comments*:
 I found no emergency measures that limit media freedom. According to Reporters without Borders, "Under the amendments to the Administrative Code voted by the Tajik parliament on 10 June, anyone providing  “false” or “inaccurate” information about Covid-19 in the media or on social media could be fined up to 1,160 somoni (995 euros) – nearly twice the minimum monthly wage."  (1) Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, applies to "false" information on infectious diseases in general, and constitutes permanent amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

According to IPI, "The lower house of parliament in Tajikistan voted in favour of making it an administrative offense to spread “inaccurate” and “untruthful” information about the COVID-19 pandemic through media or the internet. Individuals who are found to breach the rules face fines of up to 580 somoni (€49), while legal entities, such as media outlets, will be forced to pay 11,600 somoni (€998)." (2)

Moreover, IPI also argues that the provisions of the new law are vague and "do not provide clear guidance on how the government is to determine the falsity of information. Civil society and media organizations, both in Tajikistan and internationally, have warned that, in practice and without an expert commission, the only information which will be considered “accurate and truthful” will be information provided by the government. They have also expressed the concern that the law would be used to prosecute activists and journalists."

 Authorities have been using both the Emergency Decree and Computer-Related Crime Act‚ "anti-fake news" provisions to shut down criticism from the media about the government's response to the pandemic. The anti-fake news provisions are not part of the emergency measures. However, it has been used frequently (1).

In March, the government issued a list of prohibitions under the state of emergency, including vague restrictions on press freedom that can be enforced by prosecution: "to prohibit the press release, distribution or dissemination of letters, publications or any means of communication containing texts which may instigate fear amongst the people or is intended to distort information which misleads understanding of the emergency situation to the extent of affecting the security of state or public order or good moral of the people both in the area or locality where an emergency situation has been declared or the entire Kingdom" (4).

 There are no reports found that any of the emergency measures places any de jure limitations on media. While media freedom is heavily restricted in Turkey, and harassment is on-going during the pandemic, there are no reports that any de jure limitations have been imposed as a part of Covid-19 measures, or during the pandemic. Other, already existing legal instruments for prosecuting journalists, such as Turkey’s terrorist law, has been in continued used during the pandemic however.

*Comments*:
 I found no emergency measures that limit media freedom. The parliament passed ammendments to the Criminal Code (Article 244) on 23 March 2020 making spreading false information about infections punishable with a fine or imprisonment. Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, applies to "false" information on infectious diseases in general, and constitutes permanent amendments to existing legislation. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

 I did not find any information related to this across all time periods. 

But  a new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of "fake news" or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  The OHCHR have reported that the law has been used to summon over 600 Facebook users for questioning over online posts about Covid-19. At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000.

*Comments*:
 The production of "fake news" is prohibited in Zambia since before the Covid-19 crisis, and will thus not be included in this score as it is not part of the current emergency measures. No evidence that the covid-19 emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom was been found.

*Comments*:
 The Public Health (COVID-19 Prevention, Containment and Treatment) (National Lockdown) Order, 2020 criminalizes false reporting "about any public officer, official or enforcement officer involved with enforcing or implementing the national lockdown in his or her capacity as such, or about any private individual that has the effect of prejudicing the State’s enforcement of the national lockdown" with potential for imprisonment up to 20 years [1]. President Mnangagwa has been quoted in support of the strictest punishment [2]. Evidence suggests that the government has used the clause to clamp down on its critics [3, 4]. For example, after reporting about government corruption, Hopewell Chin’ono was arrested three times on separate offenses, most recently in January 2021 for reporting about a child allegedly beaten to death by police enforcing the lockdown measures. On 28 April 2021, the courts ruled that the law concerning false information no longer existed. However, the provision within the statutory instrument appears to remain in effect.
