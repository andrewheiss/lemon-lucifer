 In the province of Formosa, people were held in mandatory isolation and quarantine centers that were overcrowded and had unsanitary conditions. Some facilities appeared to have limited ventilation and access to water. Many were held in these centers for longer than the 14 days recommended by the WHO [1, 2]. This disrespects Article 7 (Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment).

 No measures violating non-derogable rights found. Two sources mention troubling developments that could potentially violate non-derogable rights in the future.

1) According to OSCE report, "fake news" legislature in countries that implemented such laws (including Azerbaijan) (see melim) can be problematic since "there may well be a legitimate concern about the deliberate and malicious spread of disinformation, such criminal provisions are unlikely to comply with the principle of specificity of criminal law enshrined in Article 15 of the ICCPR and Article 7 of the ECHR due to the inherent vagueness and ambiguity of the term “false information”." (1)

2) Human Rights Watch reports one alleged case of torture following detentions after 14 July 2020 protests, where some charges included violating Covid-19 rules. Since there is no clear link between covid-19-related allegations and torture, this is not coded.

 No, although there are allegations for violation of the right to freedom of expression - From Amnesty International's report on policing the pandemic:

''Following Adil’s death, protests took place during which acts of violence were committed. However, many people also peacefully demanded accountability for the death. The Human Rights League has reported at
least 10 cases in which police ordered people to remove banners calling for “Justice for Adil” in the days after his death. The banners were hung on windows or the external facades of houses. Police told the press that local police regulations prohibit the display of banners on external facades. The order to remove the banners constitutes an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction of the right to freedom of expression.'' (1)

 Q4 2020: The Lipa temporary emergency camp was set up in April 2020 as part of the emergency measures and according to Human Rights Watch, "Conditions in the Lipa temporary emergency camp were poor before the fire, with a lack of basic services including critical hygiene and sanitation services such as sewage and running water." (1) The camp was not connected to the water and electricity supplies, although the government promised  to do so in April 2020. The conditions in the Lipa camp deteriorated in the winter and according to Amnesty International, "in the last days of December, around 900 migrants and asylumseekers were stranded in inhumane conditions and without access to food, water or electricity in the temporary camp Lipa after the authorities failed to agree to their relocation to more suitable facilities in other parts of the country." (2) This can be considered a violation of Art. 7 of the ICCPR.

 In March 2020 the MBDHP, a local human rights group (Burkinabe Movement for Human and People’s Rights), accused defense and security forces of inflicting acts of torture against offenders of the government’s Covid-19 curfew (1). This likely violates sections in ICCPR Article 9 (2), but do not appear systematic (see pomviol). 
No more evidence was found.

*Comments*:
 While there are reports of violations of human rights in Myanmar, and especially so in the recent years, no evidence has been found of any violations of non-derogable rights in the Covid-19 emergency measures. After the coup on 2021-02-01 the violence and human rights abuse from the government has exacerbated, but as far as has been found this has not been in reference to any Covid-19 restrictions, but rather in relation to the state of emergency. Thus, while major human rights violations of non-derogable rights is ongoing in Myanmar, these are not related to the Covid-19 response. Thus, this is coded 0.

 The emergency measures have not violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR.

However, a draconian public order law has been drafted by the Cambodian government which could lead to non- derogable rights to be violated in the future. The proposed law would undermine a variety of freedoms. Examples include bans on wearing face masks indoors, restrictions on women’s attire in public, undermining the right to peaceful assembly.

 People living in Urumqi in Xinjiang were physically locked into their homes from 18 July 2020 until September 2020. Social media accounts also show the front doors of some houses being sealed with metal bars to prevent residents from leaving their homes and breaching the quarantine regulations. Footage on social media suggest that people who attempted to leave their apartments were handcuffed to the rails in public streets during the lockdown. Detainees were subjected to torture-like treatment. One woman testifies to the Assocated Press that “...when she was detained at the height of China’s coronavirus outbreak, she was forced to drink a medicine that made her feel weak and nauseous. She and others in her cell had to strip naked once a week as guards hosed them and their cells down with disinfectant, she said.  ‘It was scalding,’ recounted the woman by phone from Xinjiang, declining to be named out of fear of retribution. ‘My hands were ruined, my skin was peeling.’ “ (1) Although the strict lockdown eased in later months, there is no evidence suggesting that the general treatment of citizens in the Xinjiang region, in relation to Covid-19, has improved in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 According to the Guardian, migrants at the Croatian border were "beaten and spray-painted with red crosses on their heads by Croatian police officers who said the treatment was the "cure against coronavirus" in May 2020 (The Guardian) (1). Since then there have been ongoing allegations of "brutal beating, torture, humiliation and a case of sexual assault of men and children" (2), which violates Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).

There is no evidence that the attacks stopped in 2021 when reports from human rights watchdogs were published accusing Croatia of violations. Therefore, ndrights is coded as 1 in all the periods.

*Comments*:
 In the beginning of the pandemic, security forces have arbitrarily detained hundreds of people for breaking the home quarantine, even after the Supreme Court ruled it illegal to detain people solely for violating the lockdown rules and that detentions could not be constitutionally authorized via executive decree. This violates Article 15 (no conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment). President Bukele claimed he had intelligence information that homicides were ordered by gang members inside prisons, who allegedly were "taking advantage of the fact security forces were busy helping to contain the virus outbreak" to commit crimes. He then authorized police and soldiers to “use lethal force” against gangs if they or other Salvadorans were under threat. He also ordered a prison lockdown, holding prisoners in inhumane conditions and increasing the already heightened risk of a Covid-19 outbreak. This violates Article 7 (freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment). No evidence was found that the violations continued after Q2 2020.

 Due to lockdown, prisoners faced even worse conditions without even access to basic things like soap and supplementary food, which their families used to bring them.  As reducing the inmates' access to soap and supplementary food is not part of the emergency measures, but rather an indirect consequence of them, this is coded 0.

 The 2021 HRW world report in France (3) mentions: 
'' Migrants and asylum seekers faced inhuman and degrading living conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment. Instances of harassment and attacks remained high against minorities, including ethnic, religious, national, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) minorities.'' 
''Discriminatory police identity checks continued, including during the enforcement of Covid-19 lockdown measures. Human Rights Watch found that police target minority youth, including children as young as 12, for the stops, which often involve invasive, humiliating body pat-downs and searches of personal belongings.'' 

''In July 2020, the ECtHR ruled that France violated the rights of three asylum seekers in depriving them material and financial support to which they were entitled, forcing them to live in the streets in “inhuman and degrading living conditions.”...In Calais, NGOs providing assistance to migrants and asylum seekers reported continued harassment and abuse by police against migrants and aid workers. In September, the interior minister prohibited food distribution by NGOs not authorized or contracted by the State through 14December 2020. The French Ombudsperson said the measure constitutes “discrimination based on nationality.” 

France continued to detain people in immigration detention centers during the pandemic despite calls in March 2020 from the French Ombudsperson and the General Controller for Prisons for their closure given the risks of contracting Covid-19 and the fact that deportations could not be carried out in a reasonable timeframe due to travel restrictions. In September 2020, the government announced it would use a detention center outside Paris for people who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19 while they awaited deportation.'' (6)

*Comments*:
 The Greek government is considered to have violated Article 7 of ICCPR (see 1, 8) due to various documented cases of refoulement of asylum seekers, often leaving them adrift off shore where they face life threatening conditions or sending them back home where they face abuse (see 1 - 5). 
''Greek officials have made headlines by intercepting and turning back boats filled with asylum-seekers before those boats can land on Greek soil. Although Greek officials have employed such practices for several years, experts have suggested that “Greece’s behavior during the pandemic has been far more systematic and coordinated.” The New York Times has reported that asylum-seekers have been “left to drift in their own boats after Greek officials disabled their engines” and reports throughout the summer and fall (2020) have documented Greek Coast Guard officials forcing asylum-seekers who arrive on Greek soil onto unpropelled life rafts, towing them out of Greek waters, and cutting them loose to drift. Human Rights Watch notes that Greek law enforcement officers have also summarily returned asylum-seekers at the land border with Turkey.'' (1). 

The government intensified its refoulement efforts under Covid-19, during a period when it had also suspended asylum processes (6, 7; see also 1)

"“They’ve seized the moment,” Professor Crépeau said of the Greeks. “The coronavirus has provided a window of opportunity to close national borders to whoever they’ve wanted.“” (3). 

These developments have violated the freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (ICCPR Article 7), on the basis that non-refoulement of asulym seekers is now considered as a non-derogable right under ICCPR Article 7: 

“The Human Rights Committee has also interpreted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to encompass the principle of non-refoulement. Article 7 of the ICCPR affirms that “[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” As one legal commentator points out, the “prohibition on refoulement is inferred as a component of the absolute prohibition of torture as well as inhuman and degrading treatment.” (8; 1).

Note also that the National Security law is not connected to the Covid-19 response.

 No measures violating non-derogable rights found. Note that according to OSCE report, "fake news" legislature in countries that implemented such laws (including Hungary) (see melim) can be problematic since "there may well be a legitimate concern about the deliberate and malicious spread of disinformation, such criminal provisions are unlikely to comply with the principle of specificity of criminal law enshrined in Article 15 of the ICCPR and Article 7 of the ECHR due to the inherent vagueness and ambiguity of the term “false information”.

*Comments*:
 According to the US Department of State report for 2020, "Human rights observers reported arbitrary detentions during the COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law reported that Almaty authorities built a tent facility and involuntarily confined all homeless citizens picked up in the city during the Covid-19 lockdown that began in March. Some individuals who live near the facility alleged that, in addition to homeless citizens, others who happened to be on site during police raids were also among those locked up in the facility. The few individuals who managed to escape the police-controlled facility complained about hunger, cold, and brutal beatings. Journalists and human rights observers who tried to verify allegations were denied access to the facility." (1) If confirmed, brutal beating could violate Article 7 of the ICCPR. The measures applied during the state of emergency (2), therefore ndrights is coded as 1 only in Q2 2020.

In March 2020, the apartment block of around a hundred people in the Kazakh city of Ust Kamenogorsk was welded shut and 14 days people living there could not leave the building. This likely violated Article 9 of ICCPR and is not included in the coding.

 During the state of emergency in March 2020, law enforcement had a “habit” of using torture when enforcing the emergency measures. No violation of non-derogable rights have been found in the Covid-19 emergency measures since April 2020.

*Comments*:
 No violations of non-derogable rights have been found in or in relation to the government response to Covid-19.It could be worth noting that Rohingyan refugees were sentenced to "three strokes of the cane" for seeking regufe in Malaysia, a physical punishment that Human Rights Watch claim constitutes torture under international human rights law. However, this sentece was never executed and subsequently revoked, and the Malaysian authorities have thus not conducted any violations of non-derogable rights in this case. Furthermore, no evidence has been found of any other instance where such rights was violated during and in relation to the pandemic.

*Comments*:
 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home. 

4: 900 complaints of alleged torture, inhumane treatment, arrests or detention were made to the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights between 17 March 2020 and 25 July 2020. 

5: President Duterte gave orders to the police, military and local officials on 1 April 2020 saying ‘My orders are to the police and military, also the barangay, that if there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead. Do you understand? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I’ll send you to the grave.’

6: In April 2021, a man died performing punishment as dictated by officers after he was caught breaking the quarantine rules. He was made to do 300 squat-like exercises. He was reported to have been in pain and struggled to move after getting back home and died shortly after.

However, the congolese government were refusing medical evacuation to the Congolese opponent Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko, 73, sentenced in 2018 to twenty years in prison.  “The Congolese authorities must, as a matter of urgency, release General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko, whose health is in danger, while cases of Covid-19 contamination have been reported to the Brazzaville remand center, where he has been arbitrarily detained for four years, ” Amnesty International said in a statement (2). He was eventually flown to turkish hospital for treatment.

*Comments*:
 Saudi Arabia has both deported migrant workers and put large numbers of them in detention centers since April 2020 as part of their Covid-19 response, arguing that they as a group spread the disease. The treatment these people are subject to in the detention centers are clearly inhuman and cruel (a violation of a non-derogable right), and they have not been given trials or any right to appeal, possibly also violating their right as a person before the law (another non-derogable right). The detention centers for instance reportedly had no access to clean water and sanitation, no access to health care and migrants were subject to violence and torture by guards. Saudi Arabia faced massive criticism from this, for example by the European Parliament, and eventually started repatriating migrants from these centers to Ethiopia in late January 2021. However, far from all had been repatriated at that time, and no evidence has been found that all have now been repatriated and that these Covid-19 detention centers are no longer in force. Thus, lacking confirmation that this has entirely ended by time of Q2 of 2021 (or time of coding), this is coded 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The Sri Lankan government have been prohibiting burials which are essential according to Islam. As such Muslims who have died from Covid-19 related deaths have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations (1,2,3).

The anti-cremation order was lifted in February 2021. However bodies are now only allowed to be buried on a remote island 300km away from the capital, Colombo. However there is no scientific support for these actions (5,6).

 No violation of non-derogable rights. 

The US state report 2020 on human rights practices however, mentions: 
''On 11 April 2020, security personnel enforcing the Covid-19 state of emergency reportedly assaulted an elderly woman, Nyanuwoede Drafoe, living in Agbodrafo, an area approximately 20 miles from Lome. Her family members reported she was beaten for not respecting the curfew. Human rights organizations noted, however, the curfew was not in force in the area at that time and that the use of force was excessive and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. The human rights organizations referred the case to the CNDH, which began an investigation.''

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have not de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR. Although certain parts of the population such as prison inmates and migrant workers, are suffering more from the pandemic, this is not as a result of the emergency measures (but perhaps a result of lack of certain measures to protect vulnerable groups), and is therefore not included in this score.

*Comments*:
 The Venezuelan government has containment centres where people who arrive in the country must stay in quarantine [1-4]. Dozens of thousands of people who had moved to neighbouring countries due to the Venezuelan crisis were forced to return, since they could no longer work to support themselves with the pandemic. They were considered “biological weapons” when they arrived and had to go through these centres, under the custody of the military/police and with unsanitary conditions [1, 2, 4]. Detainees interviewed by the New York Times said they "had been crammed into rooms without beds, hot food, windows or sufficient drinking water" [1]. Some were forced to take medication for Covid-19 without showing any symptoms, including hydroxychloroquine, despite the health risks. Babies were detained and there were no special provisions for them, and there is a case of a baby who died of dehydration [3]. This disrespects Article 7 (Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment). No evidence was found that these measures continued in 2021.
