 No instances of police or military violence found in Q2 2020, Q3 2020. On 8 December 2020, the police shot a person who violated the curfew and did not obey the police's orders to stop. The police issued a statement that “the police officer did not act according to the law while using his firearm." (1) Since it was a single incident and I found no further cases of police violence in the execution of emergency measures, pomviol is coded as 0 in 2021 (Q1, Q2).

 There are several reports of police arresting and using violence against civil society activists and political opponents, but these were not related to Covid-19. 
However, ''On 24 July 2020, Algerian police arrested 44 people on the grounds of alleged homosexuality. The court found the 44 people guilty of "homosexual relations", "public contempt" and "endangering others by violating the quarantine measures relating to Covid-19". Two men were sentenced to three years in prison and a fine, and the others to one year suspended.''  (2)

 There are several reports of police violence. According to a report by Amnesty International and OMUNGA, security forces killed at least seven people while implementing covid-19 prevention measures.

Although there are fewer reports,  violence still seems to be common in 2021. Amnesty International and the US Government report on several physical attacks in the implementation of COVID-19 measures.

 During Q3 of 2020, there are a few incidents of police violence and abusive enforcement reported in the state of Victoria during its lockdown restrictions. Police where given extended authority, and it is reported that the use of force has been excessive in a few instances. However, no evidence of police violence or abusive enforcement has been found in any other time period, or in any other part of Australia. This is therefore coded as 1 in the period Q3 of 2020, and coded 0 otherwise.

 The EU agency for fundamental rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International make no mention of any physical violence occurring when enforcing the emergency measures, and no other indications of such violence has been found. There have been some large protests against the restrictions, especially during the first quarter of 2021. These have also been violent in parts, but the news reports on this do not report any abusive enforcement or the like.

Assuming that further cases of police violence would be also reported in local media, I coded pomviol as 0 in Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

 There have been several reports on police violence in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures during Q2 of 2020. 

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and one person from racialised groups has died at the hands of the police in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May 2020. In 36% of the cases police allegedly use the force unlawfully, in 21% of the cases they uttered insults. Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

In April 2020, videos were distributed on social media showing the police beating people for not wearing face masks. For example, ''on 28 April 1010, a video circulated on social media showing a police officer beating a motorbike taxi rider and his female passenger for failing to wear facemasks mandated by Covid-19 enforcement measures. The beating took place on a Cotonou street in the presence of three other officers''. (1,2)

*Comments*:
 Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse gatherings in some occasions [1-6], especially during news years and carnival [3-6]. On May 29, 2021, several -demonstrations were held across the country to protest against the government's resopnse to Covid-19. In the city of Recife, the police ended the protest with tear gas and rubber bullets [7, 8, 9]. However, these instances are related to the pandemic but were not justified by the need to execute the emergency measures. Thus, they are not included in the score.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 in 2020, there are reports of some instances of physical harassment against Rohingyans by both police and military who guard checkpoints in place due to emergency measures. However, no sources found have stated any more severe cases of violence, or that this physical harassment is widespread. While there are no reports of this is Q3 and Q4 of 2020, no indication has been found that the situation has improved, or that the authorities have changed their strategies and behavior. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods. Note here that the substantial violence by the military in the Rakhine state is not part of the emergency measures, and no sources have mentioned that the state or military have excused or legitimized that violence with any reference to Covid-19.
Since the 2020-02-01 coup, extensive violence by primarily the police force has occurred, killing hundreds of protesters. Much of the violence has erupted as a result of police enforcing Covid-19 related nightly curfews the new government has upheld (but which were enacted by the previous one). When enforcing these curfews, extensive violence has been used toward protesters who have been active during nighttime. Since this is related to Covid-19 through these curfews, this is coded as 3 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 There are widespread reports of police violence when executing the emergency measures in Cameroon during Q2 of 2020:
'Police in Cameroon have detained several hundred people for not wearing face masks in public…'' (1, 2) 
''state security agents have been accused of using violence in some instances to enforce this measure or have extorted money from those caught in breach of the rule.'' (1, 2) 
''A politicized national response to the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the arrest, detention and violation of rights of some aid workers, and members of opposition parties.'' (1, 2)

In May 2020, police arrested nine volunteers from the Survival Initiative, a fundraising initiative by the opposition leader Maurice Kamto, the president of the MRC, to respond to Covid-19, while they were handing out protective masks and sanitizing gel in Yaoundé. They were charged with rebellion, but then later released and the charges dropped. (2) 

Although violence is ongoing in September 2020, this is related to the December 2020 elections and the cracking down of the opposition parties (1).

No more incidents of Covid-19-related police violence were found in Q3, Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 According to Human Rights Watch, "Between March and July 2020, as large public gatherings were banned under the state of emergency aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19, security forces used excessive and often lethal force to break up demonstrations." (2). 
 
'Days after DRC announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On 29 March 2020, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On 30 March 2020, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''Local media reported that on 21 May 2020, a PNC officer shot and killed a protester in Beni, North Kivu Province. The victim, Freddy Kambale, a member of the youth activist group “Fight for Change” (LUCHA), was protesting continued insecurity in the region. Police responding to the protest initially stated the march was in violation of national Covid-19-related state of emergency provisions, which prohibited any gatherings larger than 20. Local observers testified that only 20 persons were present at the protest. On 13 July 2020, a military court found the police officer in question guilty of murder and sentenced him to life in prison.'' (1) 

''On 9 June 2020, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

 There have been several reports on police violence in France with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures. 
“On 28 November 2020, police officers have been filmed beating up a Black men after catching him without a mask on the the street'' (8, 9).

''The Covid-19 pandemic further revealed the heavy policing and the recurrent unlawful use of force in urban areas in France....'' 
Moreover, in the cases documented by Amnesty International, law enforcement officials resorted to the unlawful use of force while enforcing the measures, which in some instances may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.'' (2)

Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March 2020 to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities...In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to thephysical integrity of law enforcement officials or others.'' (2) 
 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Mohamed Gabsi, 33 years old, who died on 8 April 2020 in France.)'' (1)

 Neither Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International nor EU agency for fundamental rights have reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures. Germany has seen many protests toward Covid-19 restrictions, many of which have turned violent. Police have responded to the violence, arresting individuals and using measures such as water cannons and pepper spray. However, none of this has been reported as excessive force or enforcing the restrictions violently. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The government used police forces to enforce social distancing measures. The police resorted in excess use of violence, sending many people to the hospital and arresting quite a few individuals during Q2 of 2020 (1).

In November 2020, police also resorted in violence, tear gas at peaceful gatherings and arrests (see 5, 6, 7).

Between December 2020 and April 2021, there have been numerous cases of police violence and brutality against individuals and peaceful protesters in the pretext of Covid-19 regulations' enforcement. 
Police violence and citizens' reactions against it peaked after the police attacked peaceful citizens at a square in an Athens suburb during lockdown checks leading to a rally protesting police violence on 7 March 2021 (see 10-15) 

''Reports surfaced about police excessive use of force and illtreatment against people who gathered in Athens and Thessaloniki. Reported misuse of chemical irritants by police, beatings, verbal abuse and threats by riot police as well as police officers belonging to the DRASIS force. According to witnesses, the police transferred people in police station without measures taken to protect them from Covid-19 infection, not allowed to contact their lawyers for several hours and did not receive medical assistance for their injuries.''

 State security forces had resorted in excess use of violence to enforce the emergency measures in Q2 of 2020: 

In May 2020, six protesters died in Guinea during clashes with the police, where crowds were protesting against road barriers set up to control traffic between the capital and the rest of the country. (1, 2)
''A report by Amnesty Intenational accuses security forces in Guinea of taking advantage of the pretext of enforcing measures to curb against Covid-19 to escalate violence against civilians. At least seven people have died during clashes between the population and law enforcement forces. The rights group notes that a systematic crackdown against regime critics began in March.''

''On 8 April 2020, a 30-year-old woman said that a uniformed man who accused her of breaking the curfew robbed and beat her." 

In Q3, Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021, no more incidents of police brutality were found related to enforcing Covid-19 measures. There are however several occasions of police brutality directed to opposition party members and civil society activists. (see 2, 3)

 There have been some incidents of police brutality in Haiti during Q2 of 2020 (see 1): 

''Human rights groups reported the curfew was sometimes applied arbitrarily. On 24 April 2020, police stopped a man going to the pharmacy to buy medication for his wife, fined him, and threatened to kill him, the RNDDH reported.
Activists also reported the circulation of a video showing police beating a woman, allegedly because she was violating the curfew. 
On 28 April 2020, police officers stopped journalist Georges Allen for supposedly violating the curfew and allegedly assaulted him. 
The RNDDH reported police made verbal threats against citizens for violating Covid-19 restrictions during the state of emergency, including multiple threats of death.

''On 29 June 2020, protesters staged a sit-in at the Ministry of Justice. Protesters alleged they were threatened, teargassed, and chased by police, who subsequently tore up their banners. One week later police fired weapons and tear gas to disperse another largely peaceful protest at the Ministry of Justice. Police stated the protest violated Covid-19 restrictions banning large gatherings.'' (1) 

No more incidents were found after Q2 of 2020.

*Comments*:
 There are several reports of law enforcement cracking down on protesters and pro-democracy organizations, but none of these have been found to be in relation to Covid-19 restrictions, or legitimized by them. Rather, such measures have been referenced to other legal instruments, not least the National Security Law when it came into effect on 2020-06-30. No evidence has thus been found that any police violence has occured in relation to the Covid-19 measures, and this is therefore coded as 0.

 According to the U.S. Dept of State, "During the COVID-19 national lockdown from March 25 to April 30, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) compiled a list of 15 fatalities that included deaths from excessive police action such as canings and beatings." 

According to HRW: "In the early weeks of the nationwide lockdown announced in March to contain Covid-19, in several states, police beat people who violated the lockdown, including those trying to get essential supplies. In West Bengal, police allegedly beat a 32-year-old man to death after he stepped out of his home to get milk. A video from Uttar Pradesh showed police forcing migrant workers, who were trying to walk home, to hop on the street to humiliate them. Police in several states also arbitrarily punished people or publicly shamed them for breaking the lockdown."

In May 2021, videos continued to circulate on the internet of police brutally enforcing lockdown measures. For example, in Mandsaur a video shows police beating and forcing violators to engage in humiliating exercises on the streets. 

TV footage early in the crisis showed police beating back migrant workers as they tried to board city buses to reach their villages.

Police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesting migrant workers in the neighbouring state of Gujarat in May 2020 and launched baton charges against hundreds queuing at liquor stores in New Delhi.

There have also been reports of the police using force on people from the lower castes in India when executing the emergency measures.

The police across the country continue to use violence to carry out the emergency measures. Hence I have continued to code this variable as 2 across all the time periods.

 There are several reports on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Lethal violence occurred at the hands of security forces in reaction to inmates not following the regulations and protesting on Covid-19 related issues, and Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests. This is therefore coded as 2 for the Q2 of 2020. However, no reports have been found on other such violence or abuse in enforcing Covid-19 restrictions. As the incidents in prisons by all reports seem to be isolated to the first period, and not a continued practice, it is thus only coded 2 for the first period and 0 for the latter as no other evidence of police violence has been found in relation to Covid-19. Note also that there are on-going reports of police violence in Iran, but as far as have been seen these are not connected to nor have been legitimized by the Covid-19 restrictions.

*Comments*:
 There are a few isolated reports of violence from police in enforcing emergency measures, primarily in relation to using what has been regarded excessive force in response to protests of the emergency measures and/or people refusing to comply to some regulations like wearing face masks. The reports do not indicate widespread violence, and the sources are mostly local media outlets. However, the US state department in their human rights report state that arbitrary arrest and similar excessive force has been used in relation to protests and the like, citing Covid-19 violations, for instance during October of 2020. No evidence has been found that this type of excessive force has stopped, and it has been reported in several periods. At the same time, no reports of any serious injuries or lethal violence has been found. Furthermore, since no reports of this has been found in Q2 of 2021, in which Israel has also removed nearly all restrictions on it’s citizens, this is coded as 0 for Q2 2021 given no evidence and very few restrictions in place that are enforced. 
Note also that the ongoing violence in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel is not regarded here, as this violence is not connected to the emergency measures, and Covid-19 has not been used as an excuse for such violence by the Israeli government or authorities.

Furthermore, there have been reports of violent clashes between police and demonstrators against new lockdown measures in some cities in Italy during the fall of 2020  and spring of 2021, but these reports do not indicate any excessive or abusive force from police.

Also, in the aftermath of the controversial presidential elections of October 31 2020, more than 50 people have been killed, and security forces are reported to have ''failed to adequately protect civilians and in at least one case used excessive force to disperse opposition-led protests, shooting dead at least two demonstrators and beating a man unconscious.''

In March of 2021, there were several protests against the government in Jordan, including it’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and its ban on demonstrations as part of the emergency measures. Police dispersed these, using tear gas and force. However, no reference to Covid-19 restrictions were found in this enforcement, and this is therefore not included here. is therefore coded 1 for Q3 of 2020, and 0 for the other periods.

 According to the US Department of State report for 2020, "Human rights observers reported arbitrary detentions during the COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law reported that Almaty authorities built a tent facility and involuntarily confined all homeless citizens picked up in the city during the COVID-19 lockdown that began in March. Some individuals who live near the facility alleged that, in addition to homeless citizens, others who happened to be on site during police raids were also among those locked up in the facility. The few individuals who managed to escape the police-controlled facility complained about hunger, cold, and brutal beatings. Journalists and human rights observers who tried to verify allegations were denied access to the facility." (1). The measures applied during the state of emergency (2), therefore pomviol is coded as 1 only in Q2 2020.

*Comments*:
 During Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2020, there have been a series of police brutality incidents in Kenya, many with lethal outcomes. 

According to the US 2020 report on human rights practices, 

''On 27 March 2020, the government began enforcing a nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew and other measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. Media and human rights groups reported police used excessive and arbitrary force to enforce these measures, which led to deaths and injuries. As of 22 September 2020, IPOA stated it received 93 complaints of police misconduct while enforcing the curfew, involving 20 deaths and 73 injuries from shootings, assaults, and inhuman treatment. In October 2020, NGO Independent Medico-Legal Unit reported it documented 26 killings by police during the pandemic. As of June 2020 the Social Justice Centres Working Group recorded 18 deaths in informal settlements from shootings, beatings, and other violence related to enforcement of Covid-19 measures. For example, on 31 March 2020, police reportedly shot 13-year-old Yassin Moyo while he was standing on the balcony of his family’s home in Mathare, an informal settlement in Nairobi. Police officer Duncan Ndiema Ndie was charged with murder, and the case remained pending at the end of the year. On 1 April 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta publicly apologized for police violence related to the curfew; nonetheless, reports of abuses continued.''

Since the second wave of lockdown measures were adopted in November 2020, the police have arrested over 1,000 persons for violating bans on public gatherings and curfews. In the process, they have continued to engage in "unprofessional" conduct such as destruction of property, as well as harassment, intimidation, and violence according to a statement by 15 Kenyan civil society groups. (5) 

''Rights group Amnesty International said Kenyan police had killed at least 100 people in 2020, with 21 related to Covid-19 infractions, such as curfew enforcement or mask violations. At least six people were killed in the first 10 days alone'', according to Human Rights Watch. (3)

''Enforcement of virus containment regulations turned deadly in Lessos, a small town in Kenya's Rift Valley where a witness confirmed that three people were killed during a confrontation between police and residents over the wearing of face masks.''  (29 June 2020) (2).

''According to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), 15 people have been killed by the police (as of 15 June 2020) and 31 injured for breaching the curfew. (4) 

These cases have included:
The beating of a truck driver in Nakuru on 27 March 2020.
On 30 March 2020, a 13 year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, was shot to death by the police as he was standing on the balcony of his parents' home in Nairobi a few minutes after curfew. In June, the IPOA announced that a police officer had been charged with his murder.
On the night of 1 June 2020, a homeless man popularly known as Vaite was shot dead in Mathare (Nairobi) shortly after the curfew.'' (1) 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, there are a few reports of police brutally enforcing the curfew or other measures, but the situation seems to have improved and there are no widepread reports like the ones in 2020.

 There are reports of security forces using violence in quelling protests from migrant workers in Q2 of 2020, which are directly related to Covid-19 as these workers have protested being stranded in camps due to Covid-19 not enabling them to travel to their home country. However, the violence so far is non-lethal according to the reports, and thus coded as 1. No evidence of any other instances of violence has been found, either in Q2 of 2020 or any other period. This is therefore seen as an isolated event, and the rest of the quarters are coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 The mass protests against the Lebanese government that were ongoing before the Covid-19 crisis started again March and April 2020, and there are some reports of violent clashes between protesters and security forces, with at least one protester being killed. In the reports, this is in direct relation to Covid-19, as the quelling of the protests was motivated by them breaking the Covid-19 restrictions. This is therefore coded as 2 for Q2 of 2020, as there are recurring tensions between protesters and security forces which in some cases have escalated, but not a systematic use of violence to enforce emergency measures. However, no reports of any Covid-19 related law enforcement violence has been found in the other periods.  While there have been protests in relation to the Beirut explosion, the reporting on this makes no reference to Covid-19, and the violence occurring under these circumstances are thus not motivated by or part of the Covid-19 emergency measures. Furthermore, large-scale violence was seen from law enforcement during January 2021, where several protests broke out. Lebanon had an around-the-clock curfew at the time, and the protests were in part toward the harsh Covid-19 restrictions. However, this is not accounted for here as no evidence has been found of authorities legitimating the violence through protesters breaking curfew, nor that they were enforcing Covid-19 restrictions. Rather, the evidence found states that law enforcement acted in order to quell protests and limit violence from the side of the protesters. In addition, those arrested and charged were so under the terrorist act, not under any crimes related to the Covid-19 restrictions. Thus, this is coded 0, but is important to note that several instances of police violence has occurred during some of the periods after Q2, only that this has not been legitimized by Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 After the government introduced initial lockdown measures in March/April 2020, several reports surfaced on social media about police brutality in enforcing the measures. Videos showed police "making citizens roll on the ground and beating them up" (1). The assistant commissioner of police issued a directive ordering police to desist such violations. In November 2020, “the police fired on a female journalist and arrested several other reporters arbitrarily”, when they were covering a protest (8,9). “Police justified their actions by saying they were dispersing an illegal gathering…. Protests remain banned in Lesotho since the beginning of the country’s Covid-19 lockdown regulations on 3 April 2020” (9). No incidents found before or since November 2020. In May 2021, the police blocked factory workers’ protests fo being “in contravention of Covid-19 regulations”, and during the violent clashes between the police and the demonstrators, a woman was shot dead by police (4). There are also other occasions of police and military brutality in the country during the pandemic, although they are not included in the score (2).

*Comments*:
 During the beginning weeks of the lockdown, security forces used truncheons enforcing the restrictions. On 16 April 2020, soldiers enforcing lockdown rules entered homes and injured residents in Slipway and Crown communities. Three Liberian soldiers have been recalled after a woman was stabbed in the arm. One of them was later found guilty of assaulting the woman.
No further evidence was found that indicates that security forces, such as the civilian police or military, has engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures later on. This is therefore coded 0 for all the other periods.

 In Q2 2020, "“In April a police inspector was arrested and suspended for abducting and raping two Mongolian women in Petaling Jaya. He reportedly stopped their taxi at a COVID-19 movement control order roadblock and, finding that they had no valid travel documents, took them forcibly to a hotel where he raped them.” (1)

While there are reports that Malaysia has arrested and jailed thousands of people for breaking curfews and other emergency measures, no reports have been found on police or other security forces having used violence when enforcing these measures in Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

*Comments*:
 Security forces in Mauritania have engaged in violence to enforce the emergency measures during Q2 of 2020. No more instances were found during Q3 2020, and the emergency measures were lifted on 10 July 2020.

 'Security forces have at times resorted to violence against those breaking the curfew, with one video circulating on social media showing police beating, in the middle of a Nouakchott street, those who had turned out to protest against an activist's arrest.'' (1)

Another incident was found, but it hasn't been possible to verify if the information is credible, nor to find additional sources that report the incident, therefore it is not included in the coding score.
''Abass Hamadi Diallo was in southern Mauritania on 28 May 2020 near the border with Senegal that at the time was observing curfew regulations imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The young man, father of six, was helping a dark man and his nephew with the transport of merchandise when a gunshot hit him fatally in the chest.'' (2)

 There are incidents of police violence which Moroccan police has denied, but there are also reports that citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28 March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on Covid-19.'' (1) 

Authorities continue to resport to arbitrary arrests and some violence while enforcing Covid-19 measures during Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

President Nyusi critized police violence but also blammed citizes of "victimization". Reports of police violence were not identified after the state of emergency ended. Amnesty International and some newspapers claimed in March/April 2021 that violence has been used to enforce COVID-19 measures.

In June 2020, police "chased, grabbed, and forced toward the exit" two reporters from independent news outlets at the opening of a new isolation facility for Covid-19. The reporters who had been invited to cover to event were denied entry while state-owned media outlets were allowed entry [2]. The Presidency later apologized for the incident [3]. No further cases of physical violence were found [4,5].

*Comments*:
 Neither Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International nor EU agency for fundamental rights have reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures for Q2-Q4 of 2020. However, in Q1 of 2021 a large number of protests broke out in the Netherlands in relation to the extensive Covid-19 restrictions, which resulted in several clashes with law enforcement. Generally, police seem to have not used excessive force under these circumstances, and protesters have also been violent on many occasions, as well as having gathered far more people than demonstrations allowed for. A couple of instances of excessive force is mentioned however, such as footage of a man being beaten by the police, though no major injuries are reported from these clashes. Furthermore, these protests do not seem to have been on going in Q2 of 2021, and this is therefore coded as 0 again.

 There are several reports of police violence related to the beginning of the enforcement of the lockdown, in which several people were killed. Police officers who enforced coronavirus restriction measures allegedly harassed and raped women as well. Since many cases of violations were observed and I found no evidence of violations discontinuing, pomviol is coded as 3 in all time periods.

 I did not find any information related to this across all the time periods. However there is complete control over communication within North Korea. Citizens can also be sent to concentration camps for looking at online media. The Korean Central News Agency is the only permitted source of news within the country. These factors may deter journalists from being critical in their reporting. Furthermore, the restricted nature of news may mean that police violence could be happening without credible reports of such occurances.

 The police have been using Section 144 which bans the gathering of four or more people to clear people of the streets. This has led to a couple of  non-lethal clashes between the police and civilians.

I have not found other instances of police violence since then.

Reports still talking about and there is no sign that the violence stopped for the periods January-March, April-June 2021.

This does not seem to be widespread however, and no serious injuries or lethal violence is reported. For the other periods, neither Human Rights Watch nor Amnesty International has reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures, and no other indications on such violence occurring has been found. This is coded as 1 for Q2 of 2020, and 0 for the rest.

*Comments*:
 There are reports of police harassing those who disrespected the isolation measues by e.g. forcing them to do start jumps or threatening them with a taser. There was also one incident when a father with his son in his car turned around when he saw a police checkpoint (children were not allowed to leave the house during quarantine), so a police car followed them and shot at the car. The child was hit and seriously injured but recovered, and the police officers were detained. While reports in October and November were not identified, there is no evidence that the use of violence was discontinued. In March 2021, there were several protests against the government's Covid-19 response. Some demonstrations got violent and security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas on groups of protesters.

 There are few reports of violence being used when enforcing the emergency measures. It was announced that 440 military and police officers are under internal investigation for offences commited between 16 March and 30 June, 2020, and there is no evidence that the use of violence was discontinued. The government passed a law that exempt from criminal responsibility members of the Armed Forces and the National Police who, "in fulfillment of their constitutional function", cause injury or death.

*Comments*:
 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments or penalities have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home.

4: A video posted on July 23, showed a police officer kicking a man's leg and pushing him to the ground before kneeling on his neck and mouth. This occured after the man was found to have been riding a motorcycle without a face mask, violating Covid-19 rules.

I have not found new cases of police violence. However since these incidents appear to be occuring frequently, I have coded this variable as 2 on all time periods.

 Dozens of migrants workers from Nepal were placed in detention centers and then deported after being approached by the police who said that they were going to get tested for Covid-19 (detained on 12 and 13 March 2020, deported on 15 and 19 March 2020) (also see discrim), which is a case of unlawful confinement. However, no evidence suggests that these arrests were violent, and this is thus not accounted for here. Furthermore,  no evidence of any other excessive use of force in relation to Covid-19 measures has been found. This is therefore coded as  0 for all other periods.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, there were reports of the police killing two persons in the enforcement of lockdown measures; these reports were confirmed by the U.S. Department of State (2), but Rwandan police have rejected these accusations.
For this reason, but also because it is only this incident reported, coding is 1 (although the incidents had allegedly lethal outcomes).

''Rwandan police shot and killed two people who attacked officers while on routine patrol. ''People should not confuse the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 with this unfortunate incident,'' the police said on Twitter.'' (1) 

''Rwandan police have arbitrarily arrested scores of people since directives to prevent the spread of Covid-19 came into force on 22 March 2020. The authorities have accused people of violating the measures and at times detained people in stadiums without due process or legal authority....Since the measures were announced, the police have tweeted that “failure to abide [by them] is a violation of the law” and warned that those “caught” will be fined or jailed. However, the directives do not provide for such sanctions, and the police offered no other legal basis to justify their asserted authority.'' (1) 

No more incidents were found after Q2 of 2020.

 From March to June 2020, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) received 588 complaints related to the enforcement of the lockdown measures - including killings, torture, assault, and discharge of firearms. At least 11 persons died at the hands of law enforcement during this period [3]. According to experts, "the problem has continued" into 2021 [4]. Police brutality is endemic in South Africa, with over 60,000 cases lodged and 3,686 police killings  between 2010 and 2020 [1,2].  However, we found no evidence of further violent enforcement of Covid-19 emergency measures after June 2020; therefore, we code this as "0" for subsequent quarters despite the widespread nature of police brutality in this case.

 The US state department human rights report [4] states that In April of 2020, police used canes to beat customers and staff at bars in Dar es Salaam for not following the Covid-19 restrictions of not attending bars at nighttime. Apart from this, no evidence of any police violence in enforcing Covid-19 restrictions has been found, and Tanzania has for most of the coded period had only minimum restrictions in place. Note that other violence from authorities has occurred during the coded period, especially in relation to the elections in October of 2020. This has not been in relation to any Covid-19 restrictions however, and thus not regarded here.

 When President Faure Gnassingbé announced on 2 April 2020 a state of emergency and a curfew to go into immediate effect, the government deployed 5,000 soldiers who beat and assaulted civilians that same evening. Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. A video also emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten. The minister of security said an epileptic attack was the cause of death, but the family says he was tortured by security forces.'' (2, 3)

No more incidents were found after Q2 of 2020.

 In April of 2020, a refugee was shot to death by law enforcement when running away from a Covid-19 check point. As this was lethal violence related to Covid-19 measures, this is coded as 2 for Q2 of 2020. For this and other period, there are also some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government. Stopping these demonstrations have been made with reference to Covid-19, that the demonstrations contribute to spreading the disease and therefore needs to be stopped. Other types of demonstrations have been met with force from authorities, who stop them referrecning Covid-19. The force seem to in several instances have been excessive, although no reports of lethal violence has been found. There is also one report by Human Rights Watch that states that there are a few reported instances where police have used excessive force when for example scattering or fining people in areas for not following Covid-19 regulations. These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and it seems to be relatively infrequent. Note also that there has been other instances of police violence in Turkey during the period, but this has not been in relation or reference to Covid-19. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods after Q2 of 2020.

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have not reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures, and there are no other indiciations of such violence in the emergency measures. In November 2020, there have been several police arrests during anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protests. There have also been protests in 2021, but the reports on these do not record any excessive force, rather that protesters have harmed police officers when protesters turned violent. There has also been critique toward the police during a vigil in London after the murder of Sarah Everard, but it remains contested whether police used excessive force as the event was not allowed and they were ordered to disperse. As it remains unclear whether the arrests made were excessive or not, this is coded 0 here. Thus, this is coded 0 for all periods.

 While there have been numerous incidents of police violence in the US since March 2020, for instance in relation to Black Lives Matter protests during the summer, no reports have been found that any of these are linked to enforcing Covid-19 restrictions, or that any other use of excessive force has occurred within the Covid-19 emergency measures. This is therefore coded as 0 for all periods.

 The National Institution for Human Rights determined in April 2021 that there was police abuse in a case involving an unhoused woman in April 2020.
There are reports that security forces engaged in violence to disperse agglomerations that direspected social distancing measures. The incident happened in November, 2020, in Montevideo. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a statement expressing concern over it, to which the Foreign Ministry replied that there was no police misconduct. In May 2021 there were accusations of police misconduct that the Minister of Interior said would be investigated.

 In June 2020, the police allegedly tried to strangle a person for not wearing a mask. In July 2020, a judge was beated by police officers while waiting to pass through checkpoints that were in place as part of the Covid-19 measures. Since I found no further cases of police violence, pomviol is coded as 1 in Q2 2020, Q3 2020.

 There are reports of harassment of those who direspected isolation measures, journalists have been detained for their coverage of Covid-19 and health professionals have been detained for openly talking about the pandemic situation. Fewer reports of police violence were identified in 2021. However, no evidence was found that it seized to occur and police violence is systemic in Venezuela, which justifies the coding.

 There are mutliple reports of violence from police who are enforcing emergency measures. The US State Department describe it as “routine” in a report (1).
For example, on 20 May 2020, police opened fire with live ammunition at a crowd during a riot against lockdown measures in Nakonde on May 20, 2020, leaving one injured (2).
On 27 September 2020, police shot a man dead when they were enforcing curfew restrictions at a nightclub (3).

In January 2021, President Lungu issued a press statement saying that the abusive enforcement of Covid-19 regulations by security officials is "regrettable" (4). Nevertheless, police spokespersons have been on record stating that "We hammer you, we hit you, then we do detention. If you escape, you are lucky" (5) and that "police will not tolerate being dared" (6) concerning political rallies that go against Covid-19 restrictions.
