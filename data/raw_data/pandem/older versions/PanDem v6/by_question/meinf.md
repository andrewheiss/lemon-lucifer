 Q2 2020, Q3 2020: No reports on limiting media access to Covid-19 information found.

Q4 2020: In December 2020, Xhoi Malësia tried to film the protests against police violence during the pandemic.  "As filmed detentions of protesters, a group of officers approached him and demanded he stop filming. When he refused the police forcibly detained him.” (1) Since the protests were related to Covid-19, meinf is coded as 1.

Q1 2021: Fjona Çela, a journalist with Fax News television, "was barred from interviewing medical and public health professionals by the media advisor and spokesperson of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MHSP)" (2) in February 2021. 

Q2 2021: No reports on limiting media access to Covid-19 information found; since the indicents in December 2020 and February 2021 were isolated and I found no information suggestings limitations on media access are ongoing, meinf is coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 RSF (1): ''Taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis and the resulting halt to the protests, the authorities adopted draconian and vaguely-worded laws in order to clamp down even more on press freedom. Journalists have been prosecuted and convicted for news coverage that is alleged to have “endangered national unity” or “threatened public order and state security”. Several online media have been blocked and are no longer accessible. The harassment is making it very difficult for journalists and media outlets to operate. The authorities are clearly cracking down harder on all forms of dissent as citizens continue to demand more freedoms.'' 

Also, ''In Algeria, state media comes under strict control and censorship, delivering information that has to be first approved by the authorities. In that context, independent platforms such as private media, social media, satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information.'' (2). 

'The newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria approved a bill in April 2020 amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.'' (see 3, 4, 5; government Decree: 6). 

Further, the Algerian government adopted in December 2020 its first ever decree governing electronic media. The decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria (2, 7). ''Among the changes brought by this decree, Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain, in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria. Indeed, most, if not all, opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their contributors, who often use nicknames to protect themselves and their families from state harassment.'' (2). This Decree is not directly related to the pandemic, however it affects the general media environment and journalists' reporting. 

Other reports mention that journalists are required to report concrete facts about the impact of the disease. Algerian authorities very quickly introduced red lines on reporting on the daily state of the contagion:  no doctor, hospital director or local health director can announce figures related to Covid-19. Only the National Commission for Monitoring and Surveillance of the Coronavirus Epidemic, composed of scientists, can provide data on the disease. For the government, the objective is to ensure communication that is "as transparent, reliable and credible as possible". Every day at 5 p.m., at a press conference, this commission presents official statistics on the progress of the disease. However, this press conference is not really a press conference, since the spokesperson of this body simply lists the numbers of new cases, recovered patients and deaths.'' (8). 

During Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the Algerian government has been accused of delaying the renewal of press accreditation of foreign media reporters which legally expired on 31 December 2020.
''The authorities have usually been late in the renewing them in the past but there has always been a tacit understanding that reporters can continue working pending receipt of their new accreditation. This tacit understanding no longer seems to be in effect.'' (9). 

FreedomHouse mentions (10): ''In April 2020 the websites of media outlets Maghreb Emergent, Radio M, and Interlignes became unavailable to Algerian users. In August 2020, the website of L’Avant-Garde Algérie also became inaccessible from within the country. Additional news websites were blocked in December, including Tariq News, Shihab Presse, UltraSawt, TSA Algérie, and Twala. Viewers can access unlicensed private television channels located in Algeria but legally based outside the country, though these are subject to government crackdowns.''

 There are reports that journalists are not allowed to enter the province of Formosa to report on the Covid-19 situation. A member of the local government said journalists should "send questions via email" if they wish to know about the situation in the province. Local journalists complain of the lack of public information available and the mistreatment from members of government. These limitations are restricted to one province and there is no indication that the national government restricts access to information on Covid-19.

 Neither Reporters Without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists nor International Press Institute have reported any limitations by the government or its agents on access to Covid-19 related information, and no other indications has been found of there being any such limitations. The Australian authorities have announced that access to information can take longer than the usual statutory frameworks due to Covid-19, and that authorities can apply for extended time periods within which they have to deliver requested information. But this is not a limitation in access to information as such, and no complaints or reports have been found that this limits media's access to Covid-19 related information.

Note that there has been ongoing criticism toward Austria’s lack of rigorous FOI-legislation, but this critique has been in place long before Covid-19, and has not to do with (nor seems to have exacerbated) by the pandemic.

 Q2 2020, Q3 2020: According to an IPI article from 23 April, "under the current rules, all journalists working in the field must obtain special permits from the country’s Press Council. However, journalists claim the process is difficult and skewed to favour pro-government and state-run media, rather than independent outlets. " (1) From 21 June, new measures restricted freedom of movement only for urgent needs, such as getting medical assistance or buying food. The measures included a group of people who were excluded from the restrictions and could move freely (e.g. members of parliament). Previous quarantine measures excluded journalists and they could move freely. New measures from 21 June do not exempt journalists from the restrictions and obliged journalists to register on a certain website to be able to leave home. 

 The measures were initially announced until 5 July. Since then the special measures was extended several times and ended on 31 August. I have not found any evidence that the measures have been lifted in July-September period. Moreover, a group of journalists organized a protest against the measures on 22 July. Therefore, meinf is coded as 2 for both time periods (March-June and July-September 2020). 

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: new quarantine measures did not impose restrictions on journalists (e.g. see a decree from 7 November where jounalists were excluded from restrictions). However, melim is coded as 2 because, according to Reporters without Borders, "ever since the epidemic reached Azerbaijan, the authorities have been trying to control reporting on its impact and obstruct those journalists trying to cover it."

 Q2 2020: There are reports that authorities avoid answering journalists' questions related to the pandemic and that the opportunities to ask questions by the media are limited. Moreover, "On 7 April 2020, the government of the Federation of  Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision restricting access to press conferences for the media. The decision stipulates that only three media representatives can be present at press conferences given by the Crisis Management Headquarters." (1, OSCE report, p.54). 

According to the US Department of State,  "Sarajevo-based journalists filed a complaint to the FMHL in March because local authorities had limited the possibility of asking questions at press conferences and additional updates about COVID-related issues. In April a group of journalists reported to the FMLH that the press office of University of Sarajevo Clinical Center did not treat media even handedly and that the general manager shared information with selected outlets only. The Federation’s (COVID-19) crisis headquarters as well as crisis headquarters in Herzegovina Neretva Canton and Sarajevo Canton adopted decisions that banned some journalists from attending press conferences, claiming it was a heath protection measure." (2)

Coded as 1 since the decision applies to one subnational entity and not the whole country.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: I have not found any limitations on media access to Covid-19 information.

 On June 5, 2020, the government reduced the amount of information available to the public and the press and changed the time of the day when the daily covid-19 numbers were released. This only lasted for a few days, since on June 9 the Supreme Court ordered the government to release full covid-19 data again. [1, 2, 3]
On March 24, 2020, President Bolsonaro signed a Provisional Measure (number 928) that suspended deadlines to provide information requsted via the Freedom of Information Law (Lei de Acesso a Informação - Law 12.527) while the pandemic lasted. The Supreme court suspended this Provisional Measure on March 30. [4, 5, 6]
No evidence of limitations on access to information was found after June.

 There is widespread reports that Myanmar is covering up the actual number of cases and deaths of Covid-19, and that media is not given access to any information on this beyond the government approved information. This lack of access is ongoing in both Q2 and Q3 of 2020 according to a report by Article19, and no evidence has been found indicating that the situation has improved. In addition, stay at home-orders in place during in various townships in Myanmar have not exempted journalists, which effectively limits their capacity to investigate and access information about Covid-19. No indication has been found that the situation has improved after the coup, and the media has more or less banned all independent media and any transparency, thus affecting access to information on Covid-19 as well as anything else. This is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 There are reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on Covid-19 related matters: 

Burundi has been accused for not actively testing or reporting on Covid-19 cases. (1)
'Burundi’s government is failing to communicate fact-based information on the Covid-19 pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.'' (2) 

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.'' (4) 

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On 27 March 2020, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.'' (2) 

Also: ''In a statement, the Human Rights Watch said health authorities in the country blocked journalists from entering a Covid-19 press conference, indicating that the government is trying to suppress information about the pandemic.'' (2)

Burundi's position in press freedom ranking improved in 2021, and no new evidence was found in 2021. (3)

*Comments*:
 1: Monoroom.info, a Khmer-language news website based in France, became inaccessible in Cambodia on 31 March after it published several articles about the coronavirus situation there, and has remained inaccessible ever since.

2: Sovann Rithy, the director of the TVFB news site, was arrested by the Phnom Penh municipal police yesterday evening on a charge of “incitement to cause chaos and harm social security” under article 495 of the criminal code, police chief Sar Theth said.

His crime was to have reported a comment about the economic effects of the Covid-19 crisis that the prime minister made during a press conference earlier in the day. As Sovann Rithy accurately reported in a Facebook post, Hun Sen said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.”
 
The information ministry reacted by ordering the revocation of TVFB’s media license on the grounds that its editor had “selected” the prime minister’s quote.

3: In May 2021, the Cambodia government banned the media from reporting on Covid-19 related news from 'red zones'. These red zones are areas with high infection rates.

*Comments*:
 Cameroon's Covid-19 reporting at the beginning of the pandemic was transparent; the minister of health published daily statistics on the number of infections, hospital admissions and casualties, but when the numbers grew substantially and Cameroon appeared as one of the top countries with Covid-19 cases in sub-saharan Africa, the government started revising its reporting strategy and access to information on the daily and actual number of new infections by switching to daily press briefings.

''The authorities are refusing to provide information about the coronavirus pandemic to several very popular media outlets that are critical of the government.'' (1) 

"It is now hard for journalists to get timely and detailed updates," said a reporter with a foreign broadcaster. "The updates now are mostly on recovery and hospitalised cases and deaths." (4) 

''Although there is no official limitation of access to Covid-19 related information, the government of Cameroon has however omitted from the public and mass media, vital information about the regional prevalence of Covid-19.''

''Media, civil society and opposition groups in Cameroon say the government there refused to provide official information about Covid-19 to media outlets and journalists perceived to be critical of it.'' (2)

Furthermore, Reporters Without Borders and the IPI report no issues on journalists lacking access to information in Canada.

 There are reports that CAR's Minister of Health, Pierre Somse, attempted to ''impose a virtual monopoly on his word, barring his administration and hospital doctors from testifying.'' (''Au moment où la croissance de l’épidémie devenait exponentielle, le ministre de la Santé, Pierre Somse, a tenté d’imposer un quasi-monopole de sa parole, en interdisant à son administration et aux médecins des hôpitaux de témoigner.'') (1)

Also, it is mentioned that the Central African Bloggers’ Association (ABCA) launched a site, Talato (“radar” in Sangho), with the aim of mapping the pandemic and fact-checking doubtful claims:
...the authorities are not so happy with this approach, as they cannot control it.  “They prefer a more institutional coverage, like you get on Guira FM [the radio station of the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilisation Mission in the CAR] or on the national radio station, known as the ‘mother radio’,” says one journalist who prefers not to be named. “If you want to go beyond the traditional press conference, you can have a real problem with gaining access to sources.”'' (2)

 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist charges on defamation and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021 ''Chadian authorities have stepped up restrictions on civic space in recent months with long internet shutdowns, arbitrary arrests, and violations of freedoms of protest and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said ahead of the 11 April 2021 presidential election.'' (5). These are not related to Covid-19 news coverage. 

No specific incidents linked to Covid-19 were found.

*Comments*:
 1: On 8 May 2020,"Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang". [3] 

2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 

3: Chinese journalist was arrested on 15 May in Shanghai for commenting on the authorities\ countermeasures on Twitter.

4: Two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

5: Newsweek has reported that the government has been routinely restricting media access to to information about the nature of Covid-19.  I have not found specific cases of this in 2021. However as the media situation in China has not improved, I continue to code the variable as 2.

In the following weeks, journalists were allowed to participate in press conferences remotely through a video conference. Although the situation improved, according to an IPI report from 14 October, some outlets have been denied participation in online conferences since March. Since an IPI article from May 2021 says that the same outlet (Forum 24) was still being denied access to information, meinf is coded as 1 for all time periods. 
2) The Ministry of the Interior removed a video of Malá Vizita & Duše K which discussed Covid-19 treatment in March.

4: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

5: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist writing for The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research suggesting that Egypt had a higher rate of coronavirus infections than reported by the government. 

6: In March 2020, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

7: Health workers have been threatened and/or arrested for voicing criticism or concern over the authorities’ responses to the pandemic. At least nine health workers were detained using terror laws for speaking out about the handling of the pandemic."

I have not found more cases of the government and it's agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information in 2021. However as the media landscape has not improved and the fact that Egypt continues to be the third biggest imprisoner of media personnel in the world, I have continued to code this variable as 2.

 Besides de-jure measure, according to RSF: "Salvadorean journalists and media outlets have also reported being unable to get information from health professionals about difficulties in the provision of protective equipment or reliable figures for confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths." The government did not allow journalists to ask questions during press conferences about the pandemic and there are also several reports of security forces interferring with journalists reporting on coronavirus. Members of the national assembly proposed a committee to investigate the official Covid-19 numbers provided by the executive. There are also accusations that the government is not transparent about expenses made during the Covid-19 pandemic that should be public.

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS of 10 April 2020 (1), designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to Covid-19, does not exempt journalists and the media from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures. 

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by June 2021.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid-19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation.

 According to Art 13 (2) of the Ordinance No 181 from 23 March 2020 "On the Approval of Measures to be Implemented in connection with the Prevention of the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) in Georgia", "The timeframe established by the legislation of Georgia for releasing public information and personal information shall be suspended" for the duration of the state of emergency (1).  It's a case of suspension of freedom of information requests where under a state of emergency the deadlines for releasing public information were suspended. If hypothetical journalists requested information from public authorities, they would not be obliged to reply in a certain time frame. Since the legislation states that the measures apply for the duration of the state of emergency (that ended on 22 May), meinf is coded as 1 only during Q2 2020 period.

*Comments*:
 The greek media landscape has worsened significantly in 2020. Greece now ranks 70 compared to 65 a year ago in the RSF index. After New Democracy's party victory in the July 2019 general election, public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA were placed under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis through a presidential decree. Ever since, the Greek government has ''sought, directly or indirectly, to control the flow of information closely as part of its efforts to deal with both the coronavirus pandemic and the refugee crisis.'' (6). 

Throughout the pandemic, journalists had to get the government’s permission before reporting in hospitals on Covid-19 issues, and the health ministry banned medical staff from talking to the media.(6) 

Authorities in Greece, after a Greek Ministry of Health's decision on 23 March 2020, decided to deny access to health editors during briefings on Covid-19: 
''As of 23 March 2020, the Greek Ministry of Health, citing public health safety reasons, has decided to close its doors to health editors on a daily basis from Sotiris Tsiodras' spokesman and Deputy Ministers of Civil Protection and Health. In addition, the journalists were informed that they will have the opportunity to ask one - and only one, although there are three speakers -  question per week, which should be submitted in writing to the Press Office, which will read it on "air", without it ability to clarify or apply pressure in order to respond effectively.'' (1,2,3)

Also, opposition media outlets in July 2020 were excluded from a government support package in Greece: 
''Greek newspaper Documento was excluded from a €20 million advertising revenue support package organised by the government in apparent retaliation for its critical coverage and investigative reports in the Prime Minister and his inner circle. When asked why Documento had not been received funding like every other major media outlet in the country, the government spokesman replied that the government did not give funding to outlets threat spread “fake news”. (1,4,5). 

Another incident occurred on 20 March 2021. ''Kostas Vaxevanis, publisher of the Athens-based newspaper Documento, tweeted that an arrest warrant had been issued against him. His newspaper had published the full text of a lawsuit lodged against him personally by 22 police officers, with their names on its front page. The policemen were under investigation for the torture of a young activist. Earlier, on 9 March 2021, clashes had erupted between the police and some of the 5,000 protesters who had gathered in the middle-class Athens suburb of Nea Smyrni to demonstrate against police brutality while enforcing Covid-19 quarantine measures. The protest was prompted by a recent event in the neighbourhood, when a rapid response squad out on Covid-curfew patrol harassed a family and then attacked a young man who stepped in to argue in their defence.'' (7).

*Comments*:
 There are several accusations of lack of transparency and that the government interfered with the media coverage, and Guatemalan journalists and human rights organizations published an open letter to complain about the situation. The president said: "I would like to put the media in quarantine but I cannot." The government stopped holding press conferences, limited the official information that is shared with the media and closed the institutional chat group it had with journalists. The Human Rights Ombudsman stated that "in the face of the health emergency it is vital to maintain open, direct and continuous government communication with the press in order to guarantee the population their right to be informed" and recommended that the president and the ministry of health ensure that the press has free access to information regarding the pandemic.

 No evidence of limitations related to Covid-19 was found. 
The media are criticized by the President Alpha Conde and the authorities periodically try to censor critical media. 
Three websites, Le Lynx, the Guinée Matin newspaper’s website and Aminata.com, were suspended or threatened with suspension during the October 2020 elections (1). 

According to the US Department of State's 2020 report on human rights practices, ''The government penalized media outlets and journalists who broadcasted items criticizing government officials and their actions. Some journalists accused government officials of attempting to influence the tone of their reporting.'' (2) 

However, these violations are unrelated to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 There are reports revealing a widespread problem with limitations on access to information for journalists in Haiti: 

The Haitian government initially had not granted journalists an exemption from the curfew restrictions. However, ''in a decree dated 21 May 2020, the government rectified the situation by restoring the right of press workers who "are part of the professional categories that can move freely during curfew hours, as is the case for doctors, for example.'' (therefore coding is 2 for Q2 2020). (3, 4). 

''Journalists have also faced obstacles while reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. In Haiti, information is not guaranteed. You have to fight to access information. It is truly difficult to get information from the government. Sometimes it will take me two to three weeks for a single piece of reporting. You call a government institution to ask for information and they tell you to ask for an appointment.Presently, we depend on what authorities tell us. They say there are 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but there is no way to verify that information. We really do not know what is happening. We are limited to whatever information they provide us.In the current context, I do not have a source that can give me any reliable information, because all of the information is in the hands of the government. There are very few people that handle this information. The rest are just rumors. Up to this point, we depend solely on government press conferences. As journalists, we always try to find a balance, to corroborate the official information. But in these circumstances, it is really difficult.'' (5, 6). 

Also, according to RSF, ''Despite recent changes in Haiti’s media freedom laws, journalists suffer from a lack of financial resources, an absence of institutional support and difficulty in accessing information.'' (1, 2).

 Daily press conferences are organized by Operational Group (OG) for Protection against the Coronavirus Epidemic where questions are pre-selected, certain outlets are neglected and sensitive topics avoided. The time it takes for public bodies to respond to requests (such as journalists' questions) was increased from 30 to 60 days.  In Q4 2020, press conferences were being held without physical presence of journalists. In Q1 2021, IPI and Human Rights Watch reported that journalists were prevented from interviewing medical professionals on Covid-19. Meinf is therefore coded as 2 in all periods.

 From 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, the made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

After this, the health ministry’s representatives told reporters that they would only take questions from Asian News International and the state TV broadcaster Doordarshan at the next days press conference. Both news outlets are well known for supporting Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

On April 2021, the Indian government, asked Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to take down more that 100 posts that were critical to the government's response to the pandemic. And on 23 April 2021, the government blocked more than 50 tweets from people who were critical of the governments handling of the pandemic.

*Comments*:
 The Indonesian Government, does not disclose important data on COVID-19 transmitted contacts.Examples of this include recently visited locations or travel history of the suspected people. They claim that it would lead to widespread panic among people (1).

The Government has not been transparent in releasing data relating to the numbers of health workers infected by COVID-19, as well as hospitals where they are working. The only announcement by the Government was only made on March 14, 2020, when the spokesperson of the Government’s COVID-19 crisis team, Achmad Yurianto, stated that several medical practitioners had been infected by the virus and that some of them had passed away (2,3). 

I did not find new instances of the government and it's agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related infromation. However I did not find any information suggesting that the situation has improved. The laws passed limited the press also continued to remain in place. As such, I have continued to code this variable as 2 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The Iranian government have repeatedly been covering up or denying access to Covid-19 related information, and undermining reporting on the Covid-19 situation in Iran. While reports mainly pertain to the first wave of Covid-19 during Q2 of 2020, a newspaper was shut down by the government for it publishing an interview with a member of the Iranian Covid-19 Taskforce who spoke of Iran covering up how many cases that was actually recorded in the country in Q3 of 2020. It is not clear to what extent this covering up of Covid-19 cases and deaths continues, but as there’s no indication found that the situation has substantially improved, this is coded 2 for later periods as well.

*Comments*:
 There are some reports on journalists being obstructed and denied access to information when trying to investigate the Covid-19 situation in Iraq. The Iraqi government also banned Reuters from Iraq for 3 months due to them reporting that the amount of infected people being much higher than the government had stated and that they had deliberately misreported the number of cases. This is coded as 1, since there is indeed obstructions to accessing Covid-19 related information, but there aren't as many such cases reported that it could be argued to be "widespread and ongoing". No indication of improvement has been found for the latter periods, and Iraq’s limiting of media freedom has also been ongoing in many other respects. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

Even though the emergency measures were lifted on 25 May 2020, these restrictions have remained in place. I have not found information suggesting that this restriction has been lifted. Hence I have coded Q3 of meinf as 1.

 On 11 April 2020 journalists were charged with "violating the emergency situation" after interviewing doctors at a hospital. (2)

According to the US Department of State report for 2020, " Human rights observers reported arbitrary detentions during the COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law reported that Almaty authorities built a tent facility and involuntarily confined all homeless citizens picked up in the city during the COVID-19 lockdown that began in March. Some individuals who live near the facility alleged that, in addition to homeless citizens, others who happened to be on site during police raids were also among those locked up in the facility. The few individuals who managed to escape the police-controlled facility complained about hunger, cold, and brutal beatings. Journalists and human rights observers who tried to verify allegations were denied access to the facility." (1) Since the report is for 2020 overall, meinf is coded as 1 in all time periods in 2020. I found no evidence for 2021.

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports that the government attempts to prevent media access to information about Covid-19.

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September 2020), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1, 2)

''About 60% of these cases were related to lack of access to public information or restricted from accessing various open places to interrogate and provide objective and critical reporting on the Counties Covid-19 preparedness. In 7 cases, government officials unjustifiably denied journalists access to crucial information or interviews as part of their role of interrogating the country’s Covid-19 preparedness.'' (2)

''Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media's job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. ''Trust and obey'' has seemed to be the overriding message.'' (3)

 Indepedent media were not given accreditation during the state of emergency (declared in certain territories) and were not allowed to pass policy check points, limiting their ability to report on the government response. According to IPI: "Authorities in Kyrgyzstan have excluded 20 different independent media outlets from receiving special press passes which allow them exemption from lockdown rules, giving them instead only to state-run media." (1) According to a report by Library of Congress, "Only a limited number of state TV crews were allowed to report from the field, and the government has become the only source of news on the pandemic." (2)

According to Amnesty International report, health workers were silenced and received threats after speaking to the media. 

The restrictive measures for journalists applied only for the duration of the state of emergency in certain territories that ended on 10 May, while the silencing of health workers is also reported in July 2020. Since I found no further evidence, meinf is coded as 2 only in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).In other words, only state sponsored media is allowed to report on the crisis, which de jure limits all access to information as only the government approved information is being disseminated to these media outlets. No evidence has been found that this regulation having been repealed or amended. This is therefore coded 2 for all periods.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any limitations on access to information, and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion in August 2020 introduced far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon) This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found on access being limited on Covid-19, but it should be noted that it is possible that the media faces such limitations in other areas.

*Comments*:
 Authorities in Liberia have decided to limit access to the president's office to a handful of media outlets that are nearly all controlled by the government or supportive of it. However, this was part of the measures taken within the state of emergency, and is reported to have ended by the time the state of emergency ended. No evidence of any other limitations to information in relation to Covid-19 has been found, and this is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 and onward.

 Yes, both through de jure and de facto limitations. 

The Madagascy authorities announced in October 2020 that all radio programs could resume their live call-in programs.''(2). However, no evidence was found on whether authorities stopped these practices after the state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020. 

The state of health emergency was reintroduced on 3 April 2021 and is in place at least until 28 June 2021. Under the state of health emergency, the Ministry of Communication and Culture is given extraordinary poewrs to control information regarding the pandemic. (2) 

On 22 April 2021, Malagasy authorities issued an interministerial decision that suspended the broadcasting of nine radio and audiovisual programs. The programs were suspended under the state of emergency, on the grounds that they were ''likely to disturb public order and security and harm national unity " (3, 4). 

Also, “Several journalists have told RSF they are finding it very difficult to cover the pandemic. They say it is hard to get figures for Covid-19 cases and deaths or get access to the health centres mobilised to combat the pandemic, and that some sources are afraid to talk.” (5)

 'On 18 December 2020, the transition government declared a state of emergency related to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a letter sent from the Ministry of Territorial Administration to regional and local authorities, this state of emergency granted authorities the power to take “all necessary measures” to control the press, social media, and all nature of publications, including radio and television broadcasts.'' (1) 

''Malian journalists are protesting orders by the transitional administration that they see as suppressing freedom of the press in the West African country.In a protest meeting of media workers on 20 December 2020, the Union of Free Radio and Television (URTEL) rejected these measures, stressing that "in the name of the fight against the coronavirus disease, we will never accept from anyone the questioning of essential freedoms, including freedom of the press".'' (2). 
''In a statement, the Malian Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, explained that "contrary to some interpretations in the media, the instruction of 18 December 2020 is only an update of an instruction dating from 2015 declaring a state of emergency on the national territory".'' (2, 3). 

The state of emergency is still in place until 26 June 2021.

*Comments*:
 On 24 June 2020, the National Assembly approved a new law - the Law on Combatting Manipulation of Information - aimed at prohibiting allegedly false news posts on social media. The Law states as its objective to prevent manipulation of information, publication of false news, and the creation of fake digital identities “especially during periods of elections and during health crises”, like the covid-19 pandemic. Penalties for violations range from three months to five years in prison, and fines from 50,000 to 200,000 Ouguiya (US$1,325-5,300) (2, 3; see also 4 - 6).  
Many opposition parliamentarians as well as human rights activists denounced the law, declaring that it risks undermining the freedoms guaranteed by the constitution (3).

However, no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information were found.

The reporters who had been invited to cover to event were denied entry while state-owned media outlets were allowed entry [4]. The Presidency later apologized for the incident [5]. No evidence was found that this occurred after August 2020 or that other effects on media reporting were affected by the emergency measures [1,6].

 The government has taken no measures to protect citizens from the pandemic. President Ortega consistetly diminishes the seriousness of the situation. The government is firing medical staff who speak out about the situation and denounce the government's disregard for the health of citizens. The government is not transparent about the number of Covid-19 cases, deaths, and tests. The group Anonymous published data that allegedly proves that the government has been underreporting the number of cases and deaths.

 "Nigerian Information Minister Lai Mohammed said that journalists would be required to carry a valid identity card to move around in the two southwestern states of Lagos and Ogun, as well as in the capital Abuja, as part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s lockdowns in those areas, which were imposed on March 29" (1) and the authorities in Nigeria have decided to limit access to the president's office to a handful of media outlets that are nearly all controlled by the government or supportive of it. Since I did not find evidence of the violations discontinuing, merepoth is coded as 1 in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 1: There has been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in North Korea. However, the official newspaper there has called for “for absolute obedience to state anti-coronavirus guidelines without any exception, warning that punishment will follow if the rules are violated.”

2: I have gone through covid-19 related articles listed in the official North Korean newspaper (last link in sources). While the newspaper frequently discusses the number of cases in South Korea, there is no mention of there being any cases in North Korea. There is also no article or discussion on the nature of Covid-19. 

3: Independent media and the consumption of foreign media is prohibited. The government regularly uses arrest, punishment of crimes and torture in custody and executions to maintain fear and control over the population. 

4: While North Korea has officially maintained that there has not been reported cases of Covid-19 within the country, experts have proposed with some certainty that this is probably not the case. For example, the Associated Press reported in August 2020 that ‘North Korea is quarantining thousands of people and shipping food and other aid to a southern city locked down over coronavirus worried, officials said, as the country’s response to a suspected case reinforces doubt about its longstanding claim to be virus-free’.

The lack of information on the nature of Covid-19 coupled with the restrictions on the consumption of foreign media within the country suggests that media access to Covid-19 related information is heavily limited. As such I have coded this variable as 2 across all the time periods.

 Neither Reporters Without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any limitations by the government or its agents on access to Covid-19 related information, and there's no other indications of there being any such limitations.
Note that there has been debate regarding Norway during Q1 and Q2 of 2021 not exempting journalists from the mandatory quarantine of 10 days when entering the country, which in practice limits international journalists covering news in Norway, and hence also their access to information. However, as this does not influence the reporting on media and journalists based in Norway, this is not accounted for.

*Comments*:
 The Guardian reports that "The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian.", which infringes media’s access to information on Covid-19. Furthermore, the Pandemic Act includes a vaguely formulated ban on spreading disinformation, that potentially can be used to hinder authorities and civil servants from providing information to the media and public. While no other accusations have been found, there is no indication that things have improved, and the Pandemic Act does provide a ground for continuing to limit access to information. As there is no evidence that this is systematically occuring, however, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

 President Duterte's emergency regulations were preventing independent media from covering official briefings on Covid-19 in the country during the enhanced community quaratine period which lasted till 31 May 2020. Only official media were allowed to attend the briefings. Independent media could join through video conferencing and submit their questions to the moderator before the briefings started. This effectively bared independent media from seeking clarifications after the briefings.

 According to a statement on the President's website, in the period from 31 March to 24 May, deadlines for freedom of information requests were suspended. According to "USTAWA z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczególnych rozwiązaniach związanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdziałaniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chorób zakaźnych oraz wywołanych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niektórych innych ustaw", deadlines for several administrative proceedings are suspended from 31 March. The provisions of Art. 15zzs  were repealed by Art 68, point 6 and 7, of "Ustawa z dnia 14 maja 2020 r. o zmianie niektórych ustaw w zakresie działań osłonowych w związku z rozprzestrzenianiem się wirusa SARS-CoV-2." Based on this information, I coded meinf as 1 only during March-June period.

Further information on the so called  “anti-crisis shield” act from 31 March:  According to Art. 15zzs of "USTAWA z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczególnych rozwiązaniach związanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdziałaniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chorób zakaźnych oraz wywołanych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niektórych innych ustaw" from 31 March (also called "Tarczy antykryzysowej” or “anti-crisis shield”), deadlines for several administrative proceedings are suspended but it is not specified whether freedom of information falls under this category. The legislation generated debate in the Polish media where some reportsthat the law de facto suspends deadlines for providing information. IPI reports that "in Poland legal changes mean that requests depend on the willingness of the authorities to provide information." (1) IDEA reports that "In practice, the right to information is suspended in Poland, as a result of the legal framework that enables the government to forego answering information requests within the normal timelines. " (2)  According to OSCE report (3, p.49), Poland is among countries that have "adopted measures or have made announcements concerning the extension of the times that public officials have to respond to freedom of information requests or may in practice delay obtaining public information." The Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) issued a statement on 15 April saying that the suspention of deadlines should not apply to access to public information since it violates Art 61 of the Constitution. The coding is based both on the statement on the President's website and several reports from trusted sources that the deadline for freedom of information requests was de facto suspended.

 'Journalists are pressured to censor themselves: 
The country seems pluralistic but this is just a facade. There is a score of privately-owned TV stations, a similar number of newspapers and around 40 radio stations, but all are under strong pressure to censor themselves and many are owned by government allies. Since 2014, several journalists have been threatened, forced to flee the country or summarily deported for criticizing the government or inviting opposition politicians to express their views. During the 2016 presidential election, the Internet was disconnected to prevent journalists and activists from verifying and challenging the results.'' (1) 

State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about Covid-19 pandemic: 
''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government's figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown's economic and social consequences.''

 According to Reporters without Borders, "media access to information is meanwhile being restricted more and more. Since 17 March, reporters cannot attend an event at which Vladimir Putin is present unless their temperature has been taken at least three times" and "on 19 March, foreign reporters were denied access to the Russian parliament." (1) IPI reports that "requests in Russia often go unanswered" and cites a source that says "In Russia, the closure of many regional government bodies means it is not possible to request information. Other public authorities are not responding within the legal timeframe. Examples include a request by human rights activists to the Moscow Department of IT about the facial recognition system made on 9th April. Despite a seven-day time limit for responding, there was still no response by 23rd April."  (2)

Additionally, according to IPI, "individual medical professionals have been banned from speaking to media, while heads of health institutions have to seek approval and coordinate with central authorities before giving interviews to the press...Gathering information from “unofficial” sources or conducting anonymous interviews meanwhile risks sanctions or a police investigation." (3) According to Human Rights Watch, " On October 28, the Health Ministry instructed all medical facilities that any public comments about the Covid-19 situation have to be pre-approved by the ministry’s press service. Later, the assistant health minister stated the instruction applied only to comments on prevention and treatment of the disease and “does not affect doctors” capacity to comment on various aspects of their work, including problematic ones." However, given the retaliation against medical personnel who offered critical comments, it’s reasonable to believe this instruction is intended to have a chilling effect." (4)  Since I found no evidence that violations stopped, meinf is coded as 2 in all periods.

 The emergency measures and particularly the lockdown of 21 March 2020 (1) did not exempt journalists from moving freely to work, as it did not include the media in the essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions. 

This measure prevented journalists from reporting in the field, and from access to information.The lockdown was eased in May 2020, but after a rise in coronavirus cases it is since then being re-imposed in selected areas.

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on 30 June 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.'' (1) 

Further, ''After several years of discussion, a new press code was adopted 2017 but the required implementation decrees have yet to be signed. Two bills were nonetheless submitted to the cabinet in early 2021. The new code disappointed journalists because it failed to decriminalise press offences and because it provides for the confiscation of equipment and material and even the closure of media outlets for threats to state security. Press freedom violations, some of them by the security forces, were registered in 2020. Certain stories with a religious link can still be taboo. The headquarters of the newspaper Les Echos were ransacked after it reported that a Muslim religious leader had caught Covid-19.'' (5) 

''Journalists in Senegal say they have rarely experienced as much intimidation as they have since opposition leader Ousmane Sonko was detained for several days earlier this month, sparking unrest that claimed five lives.
Media rights groups have accused the government of clamping down on the press to quash the protests.'' (4) 

Also, in March 2021, during  the protests that emerged when opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, a leading rival to President Macky Sall, was arrested and accused of rape, Senegal experienced an internet and social media shutdown: 
"Network data from the NetBlocks Internet Observatory confirm the disruption of social media and messaging apps in Senegal as of 5 March 2021. Metrics show that Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and some Telegram servers were restricted on leading cellular network operator Orange/Sonatel as of early morning Friday. Affected services have subsequently been restored from 7:30 a.m. UTC," reads a statement by NetBlocks.'' (6)

 Journalists weew banned from attending daily press conferences and can send questions via email. According to IPI, the goverment "doubled the amount of time public bodies have to respond to requests. Since then, media have reported that institutions have cited the new rules in refusing to provide information." (1) Since the state of emergency ended on 6 May 2020, restrictions on media access are coded only during March-June 2020 period. Moreover, videos of press conferences from November seem to show that journalists are physically present and ask questions at press conferences.

 Q2 2020: According to OSCE report (p. 49), "the government passed a law suspending most deadlines in administrative proceedings, including those under the Public Information Accesss Act, thus de facto suspending all freedom of information requests," (1).The law was revoked on 1 June 2020. Blaž Zgaga, a journalist, received a series of threats after the submitted a request about the government's handling of covid-19 (on the structure on a newly established Crisis Headquarters for dealing with the crisis). Therefore, meinf is coded as 1 in this period.

Q1 2020, Q2 2021: In February 2021, certain media outlets could not ask questions during government press conferences on Covid-19 (2). Officials were also banned from giving interviews on rapid testing (3). Since I found no indication that limitations on the media stopped in Q2 2021, meinf is coded as 2 for both periods in 2021.

But reporters have found it difficult in getting the information they need from these sources.

I have not found any information suggesting that the situation hs improved. As such I have continued to code this variable as 2.

 When declaring the first state of emergency (Royal Decree 463/2020 Disposición adicional tercera), the government suspended deadlines to provide information requsted via the Freedom of Information Law, which includes covid-19 related information such as copy of purchase contracts, number of tests per region, etc. The state of emergency ended on June 21, 2020, and the second national state of emergency (October 25, 2020–May 9, 2021) did not impose limitations on access to information. However, there are concerns among journalists about the frequency, consistency, and reliability of case information provided by the ministry of health. [7]

However,

1: While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists (3).

2: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection (2).

 Swedish media reports that there have been issues in some places, and in relation to some authorities, to gain information during the first wave of the pandemic. This for instance pertains to the number of infected and dead at the level of elderly homes, and other information about or in relation to Covid-19. There have also been debates about the accessibility of public information such as e-mails from people in leading positions. It does not seem to be systematic, however, but rather pertains to a few people/organizations in relation to a couple of issues. Furthermore, this only seems to have been an issue during the first two periods, as no other reports have been found on it (the Swedish government has also ordered an investigation into the extent that FOI have been followed during the pandemic, due to be released in November 2021). This is therefore coded as 1 for Q2 and Q3 of 2020, but 0 after that as no reports of limitations has been found after that and the original limitations not were systematic.

 There are widespread reports that the authorities are limiting access to information and concealing information about the Covid-19 situation, such as:

1) "Prior to officially recognizing COVID-19’s impact on public health, the Ministry of Health threatened medical workers, journalists, reporters, bloggers, and civil activists with criminal prosecution if they were to spread officially unconfirmed information about the disease."  (1)

2) In May 2020, the authorities blocked a website that was tracking Covid-19 dealths independently of the government's statistics that remains blocked at the time of coding.

3)  According to Reporters Without Borders, "The authorities are even refusing to answer journalists' questions about the more than 300 people under an extended quarantine in a hospital specializing in infectious diseases, and why the police in Khujand, the country's second largest city, have suddenly started wearing face masks. Access to the websites of most independent media outlets is blocked in Tajikistan." (2)

Since there have been numberous violations and I found no evidence that the situation improved, meinf is coded as 2 in all time periods.

 Since 29 April 2020, the government hasn't reported Covid-19 data to the WHO. Journalists therefore have no access to the number of cases of Covid-19 in the country or deaths caused from Covid-19. This has continued under President Hassan. While the new administration under President Hassan has not expressed the Covid-19 denialism that former President Magufuli did, there are as of June 15 2021 still no new cases reported. Thus, Tanzania continues to block any access to information on Covid-19 for media.

 1: Any information about the virus that the government deems to be “false or capable of causing fear in the public” is punishable by up to five years in prison. This may act as a form of deterrent towards Thai jounalists and media outlets thinking about reporting on the pandemic, it’s prevalence and the government’s approach to it.

2: Government representatives at a press conference on 25 March 2020 said that they would restrict the media to only reporting official information on COVID-19 and prosecute individuals whose statements are deemed critical of authorities’ COVID-19 response are of particular concern. At the press conference Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha stated that journalists would be prevented from interviewing officials and medical personnel and restricted to only covering information disseminated at official press conferences. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s warning to “be careful about what they post on social media”, and threats of prosecutions for “abuse of social media” at a separate press conference on 24 March 2020 also fuel fears that authorities plan to disproportionately restrict online expression about COVID-19.

I have not found information suggesting that these restrictions have eased. Hence I have continued to code this variable as 1.

*Comments*:
 Much of the arrests of journalists, and charges placed on them, have been based on journalists accessing information from hospitals or hospital staff on Covid-19 which the government do not want them publishing and spreading. The Turkish government has more or less closed all access to information on Covid-19 according to Reporters without Borders and Amnesty International, and only wish the media to report on the information on Covid-19 released by the government itself. Furthermore, there are numerous accusations that the Turkish government have delibirately underreported the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. While there isn't as much reporting on this after the summer of 2020, there are no indications that the access to information has improved, and the media climate is still very restrictive and limited. This is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.

 Although the country has not officially registered any Covid-18 cases, there are numerous reports that the authorities are concealing the truth, which Human Rights Watch calls "an apparent covid-19 outbreak." Human Rights Watch mentions the main hospital in the capital being placed in quarantine with many “pneumonia-like”  cases, reports of health workers who tested positive for Covid-19, dealths of people with Covid-19-like symptoms. Doctors are reportedly required to quarantine in hospitals and cannot use their phones.  (1) Coded as 2 inall time periods as I did not find further information on whether the situation improved.

*Comments*:
 Throughout 2020 and 2021, security forces harassed and assaulted journalists while enforcing Covid-19 protocols [1,2,3,4], despite the press being exempt from many of these measures as essential workers [5]. This limited their access to information. In addition, actions taken by the Uganda Communications Commission requiring online media outlets to obtain authorization [6] and traditional and foreign press to re-register in late 2020 [7] meant that many agencies were unable or fearful of operating until such registration was completed. Others may have shut down completely. During elections in January 2021, the government shut off internet access for several days [8], limiting access to information further. Restrictions on access to social media continued for some time after the internet was restored [9].

 In Kryvyi Rih, independent journalists were prevented from attending municipal council meetings on 18 March 2020 (on measures to tackle covid-19) while the city’s own media was allowed to attend. In Kakhovka, only two local media outlets were allowed to attend a council meeting on 19 March 2020 (on measures to tackle covid-19) while other media outlets were not allowed to enter the building. In the village of Lyubimivka, no media were allowed to attending local council meetings. On 4 November 2020, journalists were not allowed to attend the Zaporozhye City Council session about redistribute budget funds to combat Covid-19. According to local media reports, the situation persisted in 2021. According to a survey conducted by the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine in March-April 2021, 20% of journalists surveyed (47 out of 244 participants) said that they encountered obstacles to attending events with the participation of government officials  under the pretext of quarantine restrictions. Based on this information and the report from RSF, meinf is coded as 2 in all periods.

*Comments*:
 Reporters Without Borders report that: ”Reporters are also facing restrictions in covering the government’s daily press briefings, during which the Prime Minister or another designated official provides updates to the public on the Covid-19 situation in the country. Journalists are limited to virtual participation, and their microphones are almost always cut immediately after an initial question, with follow-up questions rarely allowed - severely limiting their ability to rigorously question the presiding official.” (1). Furthermore, there are reports that medical personnel have been ordered not to speak publicly about their work and the situation at hospitals, limiting media's access to information within these areas. The Media Freedom Rapid Response also reports that the UK government has banned openDemocracy, the Sunday Times and prevented other outlets from asking questions at the daily news briefings. While some of these issues seem to mainly pertain to the first periods (at least in terms of reports on it), the issue of the limitation in freedom of information remains. For instance, editors for several large news outlets expressed strong concern over the lack of following through on FOI-requests in February 2021. As there is no indication that the situation has improved, this is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 While Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has continued to provide regular updates and information to the public, President Donald Trump, the White House Covid-19 task force, and the White House press secretary have been hostile toward the media, often refusing to answer their questions, limiting access to press briefings, and holding such briefings infrequently. In May 2020, for example, President Trump abruptly ended a press briefing, after refusing to answer questions about Covid-19 testing - calling it a "nasty question" (1). In April 2020, President Trump refused to answer any questions at a press briefing where he suggested people should use disinfectants and light to treat Covid-19 (2). The White House Covid-19 task force led by Vice President Mike Pence did not brief the press for four months. When they did in November, they refused to take any questions (3). Likewise, in the regular White House press briefings, the Press Secretary often refuses to call on reporters critical of the government - calling them "activists" (4). Reporters without borders report on a number of occurences, initially reported in varying media outlets in the U.S., where journalists have been denied access to information and public officials having been prohibited to talk to media from government officials (5).
However, no evidence of this limitation on access to information in relation to Covid-19 has been found under the Biden administration. This is therefore coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 I did not find information of the government and it's agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information across all time periods. However, there has been a law that has been passed which limit access to information.

1: A new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  2: At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000.
