*Comments*:
 There have been variations in lockdown measures and movement restrictions in different parts of Afghanistan depending on the prevalenceof Covid-19 in the different areas.

 However, evidence of these differences are found from March 2020 to May 2020. The restrictions were eased after this period and I have not found additional information the measures that have been introduced by the government since then. 

As of May 7 2021, the COVID-19-related restrictions in force in Afghanistan remain largely unchanged by comparison with those in place during the first week of April 2021.

*Comments*:
 Initial measures were the same for the whole country. The easing of restrictions varies depending on the municipality, with some municipalities designated as "green areas" from 27 April in the first wave and from 4 May in the second wave. Separation of the areas into low and high risk areas ended by 1 June 2020. No new information on subnational variation found since June 2020.

 At first the measures were the same for the entire country [1, 2], but since covid-19 disseminated in a different way in different provinces, the social isolation and social distancing measures were later implemented according to the local situation [3, 4, 5]. Some provinces or cities also opted to implement their own measures [6].

*Comments*:
 While it is the states and territories that enforce and control many of the emergency measures, the Australian government set up the National Cabinet (the federal government and all state and territories cooperation unit) to coordinate and integrate the response to Covid-19. In the first two quarters, the variation due to this was fairly small. For instance, there have been differences in how many people you can invite to your home, how many that are allowed to gather outdoors etc., but these variations have not been substantial and for those that have had comparatively relaxed restrictions, these have still been accompanied by strict requirements for keeping distance etc. Therefore, this is coded as 1 for all these periods. Since then, however, the response has been a bit more heterogenous based on the number of cases, available hospital beds etc. in each state. The states have, for instance, ordered shorter lockdowns at different times and in different ways. Still, the National Cabinet continues to coordinate a lot of work, for instance administrating and rolling out the national vaccination program. Thus, for the Q4 in 2020 and Q1 and Q2 in 2021, this is coded as 2.

*Comments*:
 From the policy responses recorded by ACAPS, there is some smaller variation in measures taken between different states in the federation. However, the main emergency measures are decided and enacted at the federal level. In the second quarter of 2021, the restrictions have been more specific. While some have been country-wide, such as night-time curfews, extra lockdown measures have been implemented or extended in only parts of the country. This is therefore a larger, sub-national variation, and coded 2 for this period.

 There is subnational variation in Belgium in certain measures and dates when these measures were adopted, based on each Province and Region. 
Belgium is a federal state, therefore apart from the measures that the federal government took, many of the regional governments enacted their own measures. 
However, the main restrictions such as the lockdown and night curfew have been nationwide.

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually, but these did not apply to the whole territory (no national-level response). 
The first 11 measures that we taken at the Council of Ministers on 17 March 2020, were general in nature, applied to the national level, and had no limit date (1, 2). 
But the more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the Covid-19 health cordon, applied to the affected areas (3). 

The health cordon was established on 23 March 2020 to count from 30 March 2020 around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 
On 14 April 2020, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).
The health cordon was lifted on 11 May 2020 (4). After this date, there were some basic measures in place like mandatory wearing of masks or air borders' closure, which were nationwide. (5) 

Benin has maintained some restrictions in place throughout Q1 and Q2 of 2021 like the mandatory wearing of masks, regular hand washing with soap and water or the use of hydroalcoholic solution, maintaining the health safety distance at least one meter between people.

*Comments*:
 Many of the emergency measures have been enforced nationwide. However, there have been variation in that curfews initially were only placed in three regions (Yangon, Ayeyawaddy, and Nay Pyi Taw). On september 26 2020, the government also implemented special stay at home orders in several townships. This is therefore coded as 2, there has been some sub-national variation, for Q2-Q4 2020. Since the coup, the military has maintained most of the existing restrictions, including the regional variation. Garda for instance reports that there has been continuing variation between regions, as some had more restrictions than others before the coup. This is thus coded 2 for Q1-Q2 of 2021 as well.

The Cambodian government enacted strict stay at home orders across the cities of Phnom Penh and Ta Khmau on 15 April 2021. The stay at home order was also enforced in Sihanoukville on 41 April 2021. These orders were not uniformly enforced across the country.

The lockdowns ended on 6 May 2021.

*Comments*:
 The initial and main emergency responses, such as curfews, bans on gatherings, closing of workplaces and so on, have been taken by the Canadian provinces and territories, and not the federal government. However, the government has coordinated a lot of work, and many efforts (school closings, curfews) occurred at the same time or within days of each other. Furthermore, the measures taken have been largely similar within the states. However, by the time of the second wave of Covid-19 infections, the sub-national variation increased. A recent research report (March 2021) on the sub-national variation in policy response in Canada shows that the difference in response, and timing of responses, increased during this time and has continued to vary more. Thus, from Q4 in 2020 and onwards, this is coded as 3, since there has been less national coordination and a substantial variation among provinces.

 No sub-national variation.''CAR authorities imposed restrictive measures early on: border closures (with the exception of the Bangui-Bouar-Garoua-Mboulaye line), closure of places of worship, schools and universities, night clubs and dance halls, a ban on groups of more than 15 people, a ban on handshakes and embraces, systematic hand washing at the entrance to public buildings, restrictions on population movements to the hinterland, etc. These barrier measures taken for 15-day periods have been constantly renewed and reinforced as the pandemic spreads. According to the latest news (12 June 2020), the country has now enforced the compulsory wearing of masks in public spaces.

Most of these minimal measures are maintained by June 2021.

 The BBC source explains that the emergency measures have varied across regions based on the severity of the spread of Covid-19. Examples include:

1: The region of Urumqi was locked down in July 2020 after multiple infections were detected in the region.

2: In October 2020, China started testing the residents in Qingdao (population: 9 million) for Covid-19 after 12 cases were found within the city.

3: The emergency measures have continued to vary on the provincial level in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. For example, new restrictions such as stay home orders and restrictions on people entering and leaving the city of Foshan were implemented on 1 June 2021.

 Mostly uniform measures, with some areas places under lockdown in the March-June 2020 period (e.g. 21 villages and towns in the Olomouc region). Almost uniform measures in July-September 2020 and uniform measures in October-December 2020.

January-March, April-June 2021: there is a minimal variation in the easening of the measures. In Febuary, it was forbidden to travel to some regions. In March, residents of Prague could only leave the city with a good reason. In April, the opening of shops was only possible when there is a lower incidence rate. In May, the opening of schools would be possible only in areas with a lower incidence rate.

*Comments*:
 The DRC announced a state of emergency on 25 March 2020, which was accompanied by: closure of the country's external borders (except freight); ban on gatherings; confinement of the commune of Gombe in the provincial capital Kinshasa (movement prohibited except provided with a badge issued by the authorities); obligation to wear a mask in the capital Kinshasa, even handcrafted. 
In the provinces, restrictive measures were also taken to limit the movement of people (excluding goods): quarantine of Lubumbashi, Goma, Beni, Butembo and Bukavu; curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in Lualaba province and the city of Lubumbashi; closures of air access (Tanganyika, Tshopo), port (South Kivu), or land (North Kivu / South Kivu, Ituri / Beni territory in North Kivu, Tshopo). 

After the lifting of the state of emergency, during Q3 and half of Q4 of 2020, there were social distancing measures in place and a mandatory wearing of face masks that applied nationwide. 

However, due a surge in Covid-19 cases, in 17 December 2020 President Félix Tshisekedi decreed an indefinite 2100-0500 curfew effective 18 December 2020 across the country. In addition to the curfew, barrier gestures (compulsory wearing of masks, physical distancing, regular hand washing and temperature measurement) were also ordered (4, 5).

On 14 April 2021, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi announced the easing of the curfew in some provinces, including the capital Kinshasa, and its complete lifting in others where the circulation of the virus was low. 
In other provinces including the city of Kinshasa, North - Kivu (east), Kongo Central (South - West), Lualaba (South - east), Haut - Katanga (South - east) and South - Kivu (east) where the epidemic curve is downward, the curfew in effect since December 2020 was pushed back to 10 pm until 4 am (6). 

A curfew is still in effect from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. in some provinces including Kinshasa as of June 2021 (7).

 In Q2 of 2020, I haven't found any record of sub-national variation in the policy response to Covid-19. All emergency measures are handled by the Danish Government. In Q3 of 2020, more restrictive measures were declared in the Copenhagen area and Odense Municipality. In Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021, No  record of sub-national variation in the policy response to Covid-19 was found in this time period. Denmark has had substantial restrictions nationally, and also seem to have opened up at the same pace and time nationally.

 During the first state of emergency, the cantons were classified as green, yellow or red according to the severity of the Covid-19 situation and the restrictive measures are applied accordingly. With the end of the state of emergency, some provinces imposed their own restrictive measures. The state of emergecies declared on April 2021 only applied to the pronvinces with a higher number of cases.

 Constitution: Article 93:1b allows for the subnational variation that is manifested in the declared state of emergency in the Tigray region which preceded the national declaration of a state of emergency. Furthermore, the Tigray region is planning to hold an election, although this was cancelled at the national level due to the pandemic. According to the US embassy in Ethiopia, the regional measures differ. Ethiopians were scheduled to cast their votes to elect a new Parliament as well as regional and municipal councils in August 2020, but that was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That delay lead to an unsanctioned election by the local administration in Tigray in defiance of the federal government decision, which led to the current war.
In March 2021 the Oromia, Amhara, Harari, and SNNPR regions had imposed restrictions on movement. 


Also, the Omoro region had very restricted access to internet and phone service between January 7 and April 1. This was however not part of the country's covid-19 strategy and is not included in the score for this question.

A state of emergency has been declared in the Tigray region in November because of the war. It is not part of the country's covid-19 strategy.

*Comments*:
 No record of sub-national variation has been found in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. There was a lockdown of the Uusima-region, but this only pertained to moving in and out of the region, and had no impact on the emergency measures within each region as these stayed the same. However, in October 2020 some measures regarding restaurants, businesses and the number of people allowed to gather were imposed in only some regions, based on the number of Covid-19 cases. This is therefore coded as 1 for this period, as there are sub-national variation in terms of a few issues. In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, this development has continued and in May of 2021 Finland disbanded much of the national Covid-19 administration of restrictions to let the regions base their restrictions on the number of cases etc. This process is however still guided by a general categorization of what state of the epidemic each region is in, and what measures are generally appropriate in relation to that (as well as what is possible under the Communicable Disease Act). In practice, this means that there is quite some variation between regions based on the spread of the virus at one point in time, but in practice there has not been such significant variations as to regard it as varying completely. This is therefore coded as 2 for both Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 In the first months of Q2 2020, the state of emergency and the night curfew were nationwide, but there were a few areas under stricter confinement (Libreville, Owendo, Akanda, Ntoum, and Pointe Denis) (1). 
On 28 April 2020, the government eased lockdown measures in the Grand Libreville area, including the communes of Libreville, Owendo, Akanda, Ntoum, and the Pointe-Denis peninsula. The new measures replaced a total lockdown with a curfew between the hours of 17:00 and 07:00. (2) 

In Q3 and Q4 of 2020, the state of health emergency and the curfew are nationwide (3, 4). 
In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the state of health emergency and the curfew are nationwide, but entry and exit to Greater Libreville is further restricted (5, 6).

*Comments*:
 The federal government have coordinated a lot of the emergency response and implemented a set of measures during the pandemic that have resulted in a fairly similar response across most states. However, some states such as Bavaria and Thuringia have taken more far reaching responses at times, and there are also other states in which differing emergency measures have been imposed. While there thus are some states that do differ a lot from most others, the measures taken have not been so different across the states that it results complete or almost complete sub-national variation during any of the periods, and this is therefore coded as 2. While the amendment on 2021-04-21 created more homogeneity in the measures as some baseline of restrictions (onto which states can infer more restrictions) is applied to all areas which meets a threshold of infection rates, not all district have met this threshold and some drop below it over time. Thus, there continues to be sub-national variation in Germany, and this is coded 2 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The measures taken in Q2 of 2020, particularly the lockdown but also the closing of all non-essential services, applied countrywide. A few different extra measures were introduced locally in relation to Covid-19 cases' distribution (see 1, 2).
In Q3 of 2020, when the previous measures were lifted, the government started taking gradually local measures to deal with a new surge of Covid-19 cases in places such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands. These measures gradually included the closing of bars and restaurants in those infected areas and a 50-person limit for public gatherings. In addition, some nationwide measures were also introduced, like the mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces (see 4, 5).
In Q4 of 2020, the government started by increasing local Covid-19 measures in highly infected areas (such as Thessaloniki and Athens at first), but in November 2020 ended up reimposing a nationwide lockdown and a night-time curfew from 09:00pm to 5am (see 6, 7, 8, 9). 
During Q1 of 2021, some areas with increased Covid-19 cases were put under stricter local restrictions, such as a different night time curfew (10). During Q2 of 2021, the measures were more or less uniform throughout the country (11).

 The state of emergency has been implemented throughout the national territory, as most Covid-19 measures, with a few exceptions. All travel was banned from Conakry - where most Covid-19 cases have been confirmed - to the rest of the country during Q2 and Q3 2020. 
Despite the extension of the state of emergency, some Covid-19 restrictions in the country after October 2020 were eased. Individuals were required to wear face masks in public and private spaces. The existing 00:01-04:00 curfew in Greater Conakry, which includes Conakry, Coyah, and Dubreka, remained in effect during Q4 of 2020. 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, all measures, including the existing 0001-0400 curfew in Greater Conakry (Conakry, Coyah, and Dubreka), remain in effect.

*Comments*:
 A 21 day national lockdown was imposed by Prime minister Narendra Modi in March 2020 using the National Disaster Management Act. Outside of this, the different states have also been responding to Covid-19 with different measures. 

 Examples

1: The region of Himachal Pradesh banned entry of foreign and domestic tourists on 19 March till further notice. However, this ruling has not been uniform through out India.

2: The government in Odisha mandated the closures of educational institutions, cinema halls and public swimming pools and gyms by invoking the provisions of Epidemic Diseases Act. This has also not been exercised on a national level.

There are no nationwide measures that have been issued in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. Measures have continued to be enforced at the sub national level. For example, the area of Maharashtra was put under a week long lockdown from 23 February 2021 to 1 March 2021. Hence I have continued to code this variable as 3.

 The different emergency measures introduced are similar but was introduced at slightly different times (1,2,3).

This has continued after the public health emergency was lifted. For example, the government has given local governments full authority to determine whether or not to allow schools to implement in-school education again.

Large scale social restrictions were implemented just in the provinces of Java and Bali from 11 January to 25 January 2021. These restrictions were later extended till 8 Feburary 2021. On 2 Feburary 2021 these restrictions were expanded to other parts of Indonesia to include  Denpasar city and Badung, Gianyar, Klungkung, and Tabanan regencies in Bali Province; Greater Semarang, Greater Banyumas, and Surakarta in Central Java Province; Greater Surabaya, Greater Madiun, and Greater Malang regions in East Java Province; and all parts of Yogyakarta province. These restrictions were first enforced till 22 Febuary 2021. There have been multiple extensions on these restrictions. The restrictons will currently expire on 31 May 2021(6,7,8).

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, Iran's emergency measures have been implemented nationwide by the government, and no sub-national variation in these measures have been found. This is therefore coded as 0 for this period. In Q3 of 2020, a little sub-national variation was introduced in that lockdown measures were reintroduced in Tehran on July 15 2020 due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. This period is therefore coded as 1. In Q4, more sub-national variation has emerged as new restrictions came in place in 25 of the 31 regions, as well as imposing new curfews in 31 cities, including Tehran. For this period, this is therefore coded 2. For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, this relative sub-national variation has continued, where restrictions are in part based on the extent of the viral spread, and some regions and cities are subject to more extensive restrictions. Thus, this is coded as 2 for these periods as well.

 Several measures have been taken for the whole country, such as school closing, curfews, limiting public gatherings, but there has also been much regional variation. Baghdad and Najaf have imposed curfews and lockdowns beyond the national-level emergency response, and the Kurdish region of Iraq has have also imposed significant emergency measures such as lockdowns and limitations on movement. These regional differences seem to be fairly constant throughout 2020. However, there is less regional variation and more national-level emergencies in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. Some regional variation remains through independent measures taken in some instances by the Kurdish region, but it has become more nationally homogenous in the restrictions. This is therefore coded 2, some sub-national variation, in Q2-Q4 of 2020, and 1, a little sub-national variation, in Q1-Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 Initially, the emergency measures were taken nationwide with no sub-national variation. In Q3 of 2020, however, some sub-national variation occurred as some specific measures were implemented in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and subsequently also Dublin and Donegal, Calvan and Monaghan. This sub-national variation also carried over to Q4, and constituted differences in limitations on public gatherings, travel restrictions, attendance at public places etc. Several emergency measures have still been conducted nationwide though, and for instance the situation was deemed a level 5 emergency (the max) for the whole country in October 2020, followed by nationwide restrictions again. Therefore, this is coded 0 in Q2 of 2020, and 1 in Q3 and Q4 period as some variation were introduced, alongside uniform restrictions across the country. However, for Q1 and Q2 of 2021, no such sub-national variation has been found and all measures seem to be functioning nationwide. This is therefore coded 0 for these.

 The emergency measures have mostly been taken nationwide. However, some regions and areas have been subject to further restrictions and measures than the country as a whole in the Jul-Sep period, where some sub-national variation existed. This sub-national variation has as far as have been seen not travelled into to Oct-Dec period, where it is again uniform measures across the country. During 2021, all restrictions and the subsequent reopening has been nationwide. This is therefore coded 2 in the Jul-Sep period, and 0 in the others.

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Although the Italian Government have had numerous national response measures, the regional variation has during Q2 of 2020 differed substantially, most notably in the beginning of the spread of Covid-19 where only the Northern regions were in lockdown. While several measures later spread to all of Italy's regions, these large discrepancies in emergency responses between regions at parts of the development is enough to code this as 3 in Q2 of 2020, as there was substantial sub-national variation. However, for Q3 and Q4 of 2020, measures seem to have conformed more. Although sub-national variation still exist, and some regions have seen reentrance of some measures that others have not, there are several nationwide measures implemented (or lifted across the nation) during these periods. The system of adopting different measures in regions depending on their level of infections etc. has continued in 2021, and there thus remains sub-national variation. However, as in the latter part of 2020, the variation in practice has not been so significant as to constitute coding 3, as the majority of Italy has been under more extensive lockdown measures and few regions have seen substantial differences from this. Thus, this is coded as 2 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

*Comments*:
 Jordan's emergency measures have been implemented nationally, but some regions (Aqaba, Irbid, Karak, Ma’an, Mafraq and Tafila) eased their lockdowns more than other regions in April 2020, and in August 2020 the Ramtha region imposed curfews not in place in the rest of the country. Likewise, a number of regional measures have been taken in October and November in 2020, where lockdowns and various curfews have been put in place in specific areas or cities (alongside national measures). For Q2 and Q3 of 2020, there is thus a smaller sub-national variation and coded as 1, whereas Q4 sees some increase sub-national variation and coded as 2. However, for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 all restrictions seem to be in force nationally, e.g. curfews, and no sub-national variation has been found. These period are thus coded 0.

 The night-time curfew has been countrywide since March 2020 up to its latest extension until 3 January 2021, but there had been several areas where different measures applied (movement restrictions, lockdown etc) during Q2 of 2020. 

In 27 March 2021, authorities tightened restrictions in some parts of the country: all movement by road, rail, or air into and out of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu, and Nakuru counties was suspended, and curfew hours in these counties was extended by two hours to run 20:00-04:00. 

The night curfew in the remainder of the country was between 22:00-04:00.

*Comments*:
 For the first two quarters, no sub-national variation has been found in Laos and emergency measures are implement nationwide. Starting December 2020, however, Laos has imposed some more extensive movement restrictions and the like in some parts of the country at different intervals, the latest in April and May 2021 being a more extensive set of restrictions in the capital area. This is therefore coded 2 for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 For Q2 and Q3 of 2020, the emergency measures have been taken nationwide and no sub-national variation has been found in Lebanon. This is therefore coded as 0 for these periods. For Q4 of 2020 however, some sub-national variation exists. In October 2020, Lebanon reintroduced lockdown measures, starting with numerous townships and cities. In November 2020, lockdown measures were instead imposed nationwide, effectively minimizing any sub-national variation. This is therefore coded as 1 for Q4, as there did exist some sub-national variation during October 2020, but was met with more conforming measures later. For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the nationwide implementation has continued, and this is therefore coded as 0 again.

 The measures apply to all of Liberia. During the first two weeks of the state of emergency, "residents within the borders of Montserrado County, Margibi County, Nimba County, and Grand Kru County are to STAY AT HOME". Also prior to this, the counties of Montserrado and Margibi were on lockdown for 21 days as part of the national health emergency. Since then, all measure have been taken nationwide, and this is therefore coded 0 after Q3 of 2020.

*Comments*:
 The measures appear to have been implemented uniformly across the country. However, the emergency measures regarding Covid-19 allow the government "to declare any geographical area as a restricted area". See section 17(d) of Government Notice No. 48 (1) This could potentially allow for subnational variation in the emergency measures at some future date. 

By May 2021, there is no evidence that any variation in measures was found across the country.

 Many measures have been taken nationwide in Malaysia. However, consistently throughout the periods there has been regional measures such as curfews, limits of public gatherings and lockdowns along with those measures taken by national government. Thus there has been some regional variation in emergency measures, but also some conforming measures. This is therefore coded as 2 for all time periods.

 Under the State of Emergency from March-September 2020, the government declared additional measures and lockdowns in certain parts of the country designated as "restricted areas" [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Under the Public Health Covid-19 General Regulations (adopted under the Public and Environmental Health Act), the emergency measures were uniform across the country from September 2020 to June 2021 [11]. On 17 June 2021, the government designated Windhoek, Okahandja, and Rehoboth restricted areas, with a prohibition of movement into or from those local authority areas [12].

 There have been some variations. For example, temporary bans on transport and gatherings were introduced in the capital of Kathmandu on 19 August 2020 due to increasing cases of Covid-19. 

There was a lockdown in kathmandu Valley which was extended to September 16. I have not found more information on lockdowns in Nepal after the September 16 extension. I have not found other kinds of variations in other emergency measures on a sub-national level. As a result, I have coded this variable as 0 in the Oct/Dec period.

On 29 April 2021, the Nepalese government implemented a lockdown in Kathmandu till 5 May 2021.

 For Q2 and Q3 of 2020, the emergency measures are taken at the sub-national level in The Netherlands, the emergency response has been heavily coordinated by the government, and there are no major variations between regions. Some small variation seem to be in place though, and this is therefore coded as 1. For the later periods, no measures implemented on a subnational level found.

October-June 2021: the restrictions in Auckland were lifted on 7 October 2020. The entire country was and has been at alert level 0 since that point because there is no evidence of variation.

 In Q2 of 2020, the emergency measures have been taken nationwide and no sub-national variation has been found in Norway. This is therefore coded as 0. For Q3 and Q4, some extra restrictions were in place in the Oslo area, but uniform otherwise. This is therefore coded as 1 for these periods. In Q1 And Q2 of 2021, additional sub-national variation has been introduced, along with a system to determine the general level of restrictions regionally depending on the degree of outbreak. This has caused more sub-national variation, but not complete variation, and is therefore coded 2.

Pakistan introduced a partial lockdown across the country from 8 to 16 May 2021. The measures were implemented uniformly across the country. Hence I have coded the variable as 1 for Q2 of 2021.

 Papua New Guinea have taken many nationwide emergency measures such as school closings, lockdowns, quarantine rules and the like. However, within this, there have also been some regional variation in that some regions have imposed additional measures or prolonged those already in place, such as curfews, travel restrictions and limits on public gatherings. This is therefore coded as 2. For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, however, restrictions have been more homogenous and PNG have issued extensive measures nationwide to combat larger outbreaks than previously. Within this, some smaller sub-national variation has still existed, and this is therefore coded as 1 for these periods.

 Most measures have been delegated to the regional authorities with some regions taking stronger measures and for a longer period of time. On 2 April 2020, President Putin said that he gave regional authorities additional power to tackle the crisis due to regional differences and all regions declared a state of high alert.

*Comments*:
 The measures in Q2 2020 were overall uniform, including the lockdown, except for a few cases: ''Transport between different provinces and the city of Kigali is permitted, except for movement to and from Rusizi and Rubavu districts. Public transport in Rusizi and Rubavu districts remains closed. Motos may carry passengers, except in Rusizi and Rubavu districts.'' (see 1-4). 

In Q3 2020, the nationwide night curfew was maintained, but there were a few subnational differences in the measures: there was a local lockdown in six areas in Nyamagabe and Nyamasheke and travel restrictions were increased in Kigali and the western district of Rusizi, with public transport in and out of the capital being banned. In Q4 of 2020, the measures were maintained but there was a change in the night curfew hours (5-8). 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, most of these measures were also in place, with a few differences: 
In January 2021 the authorities reinstated the lockdown in Kigali, which was eased in February 2021. (9 - 13 ).

*Comments*:
 During Q2-Q3 of 2020, Saudi Arabia imposed several nationwide emergence measures, but also a number of regional measures, primarily specific lockdowns and curfews (or easing of these). This is therefore coded as 2, as there's some regional variation along with several measures in place for the whole country. From Q4 and onward, however, all restrictions seem to be in place nationwide and no sub-national variation has been found. This is therefore coded as 0.

 During the first state of emergency, the government's plan for reopening the country was gradual, and in each fase some regions are allowed to open to "a new normal". The second state of emergency allows autonomous regions to decide whether or not to close their region, and it declares a mandatory curfew in all of Spain, except the Canary Islands.

 A 52 day island wide lockdown was introduced in Sri Lanka on 20 March 2020.

After this, curfews were selectively implmented in certain regions based on the Covid situation.

For example,  a qurantine curfew was implmented in the Gampaha District in October 2020 after multiple cases of Covid-19 was detected in the area (3).

There were slight variations in the emergency measures at the sub-national level in Q1 of 2021. However a nation wide lockdown was implemented in May 2021 (5). There were no variations at the sub-national level after this was introduced.

 On 18 April, 2020, authorities effected a lockdown in Khartoum and North Darfur. From July 8, 2020, these lockdowns have been gradually lifted. In October 2020, a curfew was declared in Port Sudan and Swakin Towns, but with no reference to Covid-19. No evidence found for differing regional measures in Q1 2021. [10] On March 25, 2021, "North Darfur state announced the suspension of studies in basic and secondary schools for a week." [9] On May 2, 2021 the Health Emergency Committee in North Kordofan declared a State of Health Emergency. [8]

 For Q2 and Q3 of 2020, the emergency measures have been taken nationwide and no sub-national variation has been found. This is therefore coded as 0. In Q4 of 2020, some regions introduced somewhat stricter measures, and this is therefore coded as 1. For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, there has again only been nationwide restrictions in place (although some differences have occurred in terms of regional recommendations, but these are only recommendations and not restrictions).

 Switzerland being a federal state grants a lot of independence to the cantons on how to issue regulations. Although the Ordinances containing the emergency measures were taken at the Federal level, there is still variation among the regions, Switzerland has had both a lot of nationwide emergency measures such as lockdowns and school closings, and emergency measures taken by the states such as curfews and varied timing of reopening. This has continued throughout the coded period, where national and sub-national measures have been in effect. This is therefore coded 2 for all periods.

 The state of emergency has been countrywide throughout since its introduction. During Q2 of 2020, there was also a nationwide curfew which was lifted in June 2020.
Since August 2020 there had been a few areas in Togo where the coronavirus measures differed: a lockdown and curfew was initially imposed in the towns of Sokodé, Tchamba and Adjengre, and subsequently in the prefectures concerned. 

These local lockdowns and curfew were maintained in Q1 of 2021: ''The northern Savanes region is under an indefinite lockdown. A 2000-0500 curfew is in place. Movement and travel restrictions are reportedly in effect in Sokode, Tchamba, and Adjengre.'' (8)

 In August 2020, a curfew was imposed in the Kef province and the cities of Hamma and Hamma Gharbia

On October 16, 2020, a curfew was imposed in 16 of 24 governorates. But it was changed to a nationwide night-time curfew on October 30, 2020. 
It appears that the measures adopted during the first two quarters of 2021 have been standardized at the national level. "Update 2021-01-26: The measures in force in Tunisia until recently were renewed on Saturday (23 January). A countrywide curfew remains in force from 08:00 p.m. to 05:00 a.m. (local time). Gatherings as well as travel between cities are prohibited." [7]

For example, on March 30, April 4, April 10, April 18 etc in 2020., different areas and cities were put under quarantine, lockdown, or were obliged to introduced mandatory face masks. In the later periods, however,  became uniform and nationwide, and all extensive measures such as curfews, lockdowns, closing of businesses and the like have been taken at the national level.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been implemented across the UK and the response is more or less uniform. The city and the surrounding area of Leicester has been an exception from the beginning, due to the high prevalence of Covid-19 cases. Between July and September, the emergency measures differed slightly more; England for instance started some reopening that differed from other parts of the UK, such as opening school for some age groups and allowing a larger set of people to gather at the same place. These differences were relatively small though, therefore these periods are coded as 1. Since October 14 2020, the first Covid-19 tier regulations came into force, which split the UK in 3 different tiers followed by respective three levels of restrictions. This regulation was replaced by a more rigorous nationwide lockdown regulations on November 5 (until December 1). However, a national countrywide three-tier legal framework was reintroduced on 2 December 2020: ''The government will replace them on 2 December with a regionally-differentiated approach, where different tiers of restrictions apply in different parts of the country. These tiers will be strengthened compared to the previous tiers in order to prevent a return to growing infections''. This tier system was in place until March 29 2021, and the relative sub-national variation continued within England, as well as sub-national variation caused by somewhat different restrictions in the four different countries. For Q2 of 2021, there still remain some sub-national variation, but now pertaining to differences in the speed and phasing of opening up and loosening restrictions. This is therefore coded 2 for both Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

*Comments*:
 The national emergency does not determine how states respond to Covid-19, it opens up a lot of federal leeway to aid states and territories in differing ways and allows federal agencies to contribute to for example health care and emergency actions. So it has been up to the states to themselves determine their response to the pandemic. The states differ in terms of what and how many emergency measures and Covid-19 related regulation they have enacted, as is shown both by the National Governors Associations compilation of policy and legislation in all states and territories, and in the National Conference of State Legislatures (an interest organization for legislatures) compiling of data on state legislation during the pandemic. While a lot of states have taken similar or the same actions on a number of areas, the overall difference - both in content and in the timing of initiating restrictions and beginning to lift them - lead the overall interpretation of the subnational variation to be coded as 3. Note that during the spring of 2021, most states have relaxed many of the restrictions and have relatively few measures left. However, the way they have reopened has differed, and restrictions in terms of mask wearing, whether bars and restaurants are open (and for what time, with what capacity etc.) and the like still differs, both between states and between counties within states. This is therefore coded 3 for this period as well, although there seems to be a movement toward less sub-national variation.

 At first the measures applied to the entire country, but later there were some local local adjustments. For example, in some places schools reopened before others.
With the significant spike in cases beginning in late 2020, there is not much evidence of a sub-national variance in the response.

 People living in different parts of Vietnam have been living with different types of restrictions depending on the Covid-19 situation in the different areas. For example, a lockdown was imposed in the city of Hai Duong on 14 August 2020 after new cases were found in the area from 7 August 2020. 

I have not found evidence of sub-national variation in the first quarter of 2021.

In an attempt to tacking the recent rise in Covid-19 cases, strict public health measures were imposed in hotspots of Hanoi, Da Nang and the provinces of Bac Giang and Bac Ninh on 18 May 2021 to 18 June 2021.
