*Comments*:
 On a federal level, the two enabling laws (Special Powers Laws, see 4 and 5) of 27 March 2020 were adopted by the federal parliament granting special powers to the King (i.e. the Federal Government) for three months.
''The draft proposal explains that the government has to keep the Chamber of Representatives informed about the measures it takes in virtue of its special powers. However, this obligation was not formalised in the final act.'' (2)

''Most of the restrictive measures taken in response to Covid-19 were taken by Ministerial Decrees. These decrees are signed by one minister, authorized by the government, and are usually meant to cover secondary and complementary measures. The Ministerial Decrees used to contain the spread of the virus supposedly find their legal basis in a Law on Civil Security of 2007, assigning competence to the Minister of Home Affairs in case of imminent circumstances. However, both the nature of Ministerial Decrees and the Law of 2007 do not allow for this type of decision-making to implement longstanding measures that drastically limit citizens’ freedoms. The legal basis has therefore been found inadequate by numerous legal scholars, who have already called upon the government to create a proper legal framework for the restrictive measures taken in light of the pandemic. Without the presence of such a law that is adopted by Parliament and imposes limits on what type of restrictions the government can take, the measures taken by the Belgian federal government are currently unlawful and present a significant threat to the principles of the rule of law. It should be noted that, so far, the Council of State (composed of both an advisory body and jurisdictional body) has not seen any harm in the law that currently serves as a legal basis.'' (7) 

''The Belgian Covid-19 response has been widely criticized for its lack of a sufficient legal basis and parliamentary involvement. In January 2021, ten months after the start of the first lockdown, the government finally introduced a ‘Pandemiewet’ (Pandemic law (15)), to serve as a legal basis for this and all following pandemics. (7) The Pandemic Law has not been fully introduced as of 17 May 2021. It passed its first hearing in Parliament on 7 May 2021. (8)

*Comments*:
 President Tshisikedi initially declared a state of emergency on 25 March 2020, without consulting the legislature. At that time, the legislature had suspended its sessions due to Covid-19. Afterward, legal scholars and members of the legislature questioned the president's authority to declare a state of emergency without consulting the Prime Minister or heads of the two chambers. In response to threats of impeachment, President Tshishikedi consulted the Constitutional Court, which overturned a prior 2019 decision by declaring that the president has the choice whether the consult with the legislature prior to adopting a state of emergency. Subsequently, the legislature approved several 15 day extensions to the state of emergency up until it ended on 22 July 2020. Therefore, we treat this as the legislature approving the measures, despite the initial 30-days allowed without its approval in March/April 2020. 

Measures in place since the end of the state of emergency have been made by the Ministry of Interior and Presidential proclamations. These make no reference to a specific legal instrument and have not required legislative approval.

*Comments*:
 The French Assemblée National approved on 21 March 2020 a legal text that would introduce a “state of health emergency” in France during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The law would give the French prime minister “the power to declare, by decree and upon recommendation of the Health minister, general measures setting limits to the freedom of movement, the freedom to enterprise and the freedom to congregate and would allow him to proceed to the requisition of all necessary goods and services to fight against a health disaster.”

The law of 11 July 2020 was approved by the Constitutional Court and the National Assembly on 9 July 2020.
The second state of health emergency was voted by Assemblee Nationale on 5 November 2020. The state of health emergency had been extended several times during 2021 and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly, gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (6)

 Law n°002/2020 of 25 April 2020 (3) on the duration of the state of emergency was approved by the National Assembly which extended it for 15 more days (1, 2). 

The new law under Constitution art 47 giving the executive special powers was also approved by the National Assembly on 11 May 2020 (4). 

All later extensions of the state of health emergency have been approved by the National Assembly (see for example 5, 6, 7). 

However, there have been criticisms against the government for delaying to get parliament authorization for some of the extensions (see 8, 9, 10).

 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. This amendment had to be passed by the Bundestag (though not the Bundesrat), and was on 2021-04-21.

 The legislature adopted the Imposition of Restrictions Act (Act 1012) on 21 March 2020, which provides the president powers to declare emergency restrictions without authorization by the parliament. So while the legislature assented to the general legislation, it did not approve the specific declarations made by the President or any restrictions imposed therein.

 The Legislative Acts containing measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic have been approved by the Parliament after their issuance. The lockdown decision was part of a group of measures that were approved with a Legislative Act, but its specific content and details were issued through a Ministerial Decision (KYΑ Δ1 α/Γ.Π οικ 20036/2020 - ΦΕΚ 986/Β/22-3-2020) (4), which technically does not need (nor was granted) parliamentary approval, but it requires authorization by being published on the Government Gazette. The same procedure applied to all other measures and lockdown decisions: they were issued as Ministerial Decisions but legally referred to the initial Covid-19 Legislative Acts.

 The extensions of the state of emergency were all approved by Parliament. 
The state of health emergency is renewed each month by the National Assembly, whose vote is then ratified by a decree of the President of the Republic. (5) 

Between 16 and 26 February 2021, there was no state of emergency in the country. The last extension had taken place on 14 January 2021, for a period of one month (till 15 February 2021). The President declared a new state of emergency on 26 February 2021, which was also approved by Parliament. (8) 

Guinea had a Constitutional referendum that led to the Constitution of 14 April 2020 being adopted (6). 

''Unlike the 12-days deadline provided for decreeing a state of emergency by the President of the Republic, the constitution of 14 April 2020 does not set a deadline for the National Assembly as to the extension. However, the state of emergency ceases to be in force at the expiration of the period provided for in the ordinance adopted. And for there to be an extension, an authorization from the National Assembly is required, an ordinance issued for this purpose by the President of the Republic and an announcement of the extension in the official journal.

*Comments*:
 The Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance gives the government the right to execute restrictions without parliament first approving these, and the law itself was in place before the pandemic. Therefore, the legislature need not and has not approved (or disapproved) the legal instrument or restrictions taken under it.

*Comments*:
 The constitution states that both the government and the parliement can declare a state of emergency, but that a government-declared state of emergency has a much shorter time limit and can be terminated by the parliament. This was a state of emergency declared by the government, and the parliament did thus not approve it. Note that the system for declaring states of emergencies (and how long they have effect) has been changed by the entrance of the Coronavirus Law (see comments and sources for emlaw for more information), but the SoE is the same in the sense that the government introduced it and parliament did not vote on it.

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid-19 measures were implemented with the Presiential Directive on 15 March 2020, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: ''The Public Health (Prevention, control and suppression of Covid-19) Rules, 2020 - Arrangement of Regulations'', by the legal notice n.49 on 3 April 2020, and the ''Public Order Act'' (legal notice n.36, 26 March 2020), all with immediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of Covid-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament's interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of Covid-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3) 

''Parliament has continued to rubber stamp the actions of the Executive and has in some instances wholly exempted some of the Covid-19 rules from scrutiny pursuant to Section 14 of the Statutory Instruments Act. Therefore, despite being mandated under the Constitution to facilitate public participation, Parliament has allowed this and its oversight role to be reduced to a cosmetic exercise which has unsurprisingly led to public outcry. As of 27 March 2021, government directives imposing movement restrictions and an extended and modified curfew have been put in place in response to the high positivity rates in the country. The executive has validated an illegal process by publishing the rules without parliamentary approval, once again undermining the rule of law. Public participation requests have become 24-hour alerts relayed to only a few select persons or organizations to tick a compliance box which cannot constitute meaningful public participation.'' (7)

 No, the parliament did not have to approve a medical state of emergency. Note that the parliament had to and did approve the state of emergency enacted in relation to the Beirut explosion, but this was a general state of emergency which differs from the medical one in place for the Covid-19 restrictions, which does not demand parliamentary approval.

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (7). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October 2020), local news reported the contrary (4.6). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April 2020 state of emergency. According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration, without requirement of parliamentary approval (8). Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a Legal Notice on 28 April 2021, that he extends the state of disaster until 30 October 2021 (9).

 The legislature approved the State of Emergency declared by the president, and extended it to 60 days instead of 21. There is no requirement that the legislature approves the National Health Emergency however, which can be declared by the Health Minister if the spread of a dangerous disease exists within the country. This is therefore coded 0 for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The parliament does not need to, and therefore has not, approved the orders taken with reference The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988 during a crisis such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

The parliament does not need to approve of the state of emergency. The King has the responsibility to declare a state of emergency and this was done after it was requested by the Prime Minister.

*Comments*:
 In addition to the developments below, Mali is facing internal political turbulence, and the President and Prime Minister resigned on 18 August 2020 following a military coup:
''On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced his resignation, explaining that he had no other choice but to submit to the will of his army in revolt to prevent blood from being spilled.'' (1, 2, 3). 
'Mali parliamentary elections were held on 29 March 2020 (second round on 19 April 2020) despite the coronavirus situation, as they had been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on 2 May 2020. (4, 5). The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on 12 May 2020.

Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on 1 April 2020 that authorized the government to take Covid-19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from 1 April until May 2020 when the parliamentary elections will have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020, nor if it was adopted at all.

The second state of emergency of 18 December 2020 (extended until 26 June 2021) has not been approved by the Parliament, since Mali has not held new legislative elections (6).

*Comments*:
 The Nigerien legislature adopted unanimously (90 votes in favor, zero against and zero abstentions) on 11 April 2020 the bill extending the State of Emergency until 11 July 2020 (1, 2). 
When the President announced the declaration of the State of Emergency on 27 March 2020 (3, 4), he did not specify an end date. A limit date was added on 11 April 2020, when the bill was approved by the National Assembly, and further extended until 11 July 2020. The initial declaration of the State of Emergency did not require the approval of the Parliament.

The Nigerien Parliament approved the extension of the SoE in October 2020 for a period of three months, until 10 January 2021 (see 5). This extension - from July 2020 to October 2020 - was not voted in Parliament, but the government had already secured authorization to legislate by Ordinance during parliamentary inter-session periods: 
''This draft ordinance is made in accordance with law n ° 2020-030 of 2 July 2020, empowering the Government to issue ordinances during parliamentary inter-session and this, after opinion of the Constitutional Court. '' (see 6, 7).

The National Assembly adopted in the plenary of 8 April 2021 a Bill ratifying Ordinance No. 2021-01 of 5 January 2021, extending the state of health emergency throughout the territory of the Republic of Niger (see 8). 

Further, the National Assembly adopted a bill with 90 votes in favor, 19 against and zero (0) abstentions that extends, by three months, the state of emergency throughout the territory of Niger for the period from 5 May 2021 to 05 August 2021 (see 9).

 March-June 2020: The parliament was dissolved since 16 February 2020 due to parliamentary elections (i.e. not covid-19) and therefore the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency were made by the government. Each decision has provisions for the need to be approved by the parliament, as soon as it is able to meet. At the time of coding, the parliament has met and but not yet approved the decisions (both to declare a state of emergency and to extend it several times) yet.

July-September 2020: Declaration of emergency measures based on "Zakon za zaštita na naselenieto od zarazni bolesti" does not need to be approved by the legislature.

October-December 2020, January-March, April-June 2021: The declaration of a state of crisis does not need to be approved by the legislature. However, the parliament is reponsible for approval of extensions of the state of crisis. Therefore, emlegapp is coded as 1.

 In Q2 of 2020, the parliament had to pass the Corona Act for it to come in effect. The underlying legislation for the subsequent main legal instrument, "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases) (§ 4-1.), was already in place since 1994. However, the amendments that were made in order to use it for Covid-19 measures had to be and were passed by parliament on June 23 2020. Parliament has also passed several other amendments after that.

 The head of state is allowed to declare a state of national emergency/pandemic situation without needing parliamentary approval (laws made under this state of emergency - emergency laws - does need parliamentary approval however). For the Pandemic Act, this in itself was passed by parliament. However, the activation of that instrument which enables all measures requires no involvement of parliament, as the head of state declares a pandemic situation which triggers available measures (Para 4; National Pandemic act). Thus, this is coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 In Senegal, the National Assembly voted on 1 April 2020 the bill empowering the President of the Republic to "take, by ordinances, measures within the domain of the law to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic". 
The President had said on 23 March 2020 when he declared a state of emergency: "I will refer to the National Assembly a bill empowering the President of the Republic to take, for a period of three months, measures within the domain of the law".

''Senegalese deputies on 11 January 2021 adopted a law authorizing the President of the Republic to establish a curfew without declaring a state of emergency and without having to submit its decision to the National Assembly, a procedure considered too cumbersome (admitted also by the government itself) in the event of a health crisis or natural disaster. 
The new text aims to "cope more quickly with health crises and natural disasters" by "allowing" the administrative authorities to have the means of rapid intervention ", according to the head of the communication service of the presidency , Seydou Guèye.
The president will henceforth be able to decree a curfew or restrictions on movement without declaring a state of emergency or a state of siege. Depending on the circumstances, he may also delegate these powers to the Minister of the Interior, to regional governors or to departmental prefects.'' (5)

*Comments*:
 At the moment Sudan does not have a legislature. Therefore the emergency response could not be approved. "A State of Health Emergency was declared in Sudan, supported by articles 40–41 of the Constitution. The declaration of a state of emergency is not legitimate if the Legislative Council does not ratify it. However, Sudan does not have a legislature and therefore the emergency response could not be approved as required by its Constitution." [4]

*Comments*:
 According to the Swiss Constitution - article 185, the Federal Council is authorised by law to take emergency decisions without the involvement of Parliament, but according to Article 7d of the Government and Administration Organization Act of 21 March 1997, the emergency ordinances of the government must be ratified by Parliament after six months at the latest. The Federal Council defined the Covid-19 crisis an “extraordinary situation” under Article 185 al. 3 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the Epidemics Act, therefore granting the Federal Council (government) with authorization by the Constitution and by law to take this decision without the involvement of Parliament.
Ordinance 1, 2 and 3 were introduced and implemented without parliamentary approval. The Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on 25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers “only to the extent that they are required to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic.” While parliament approved the law, the Act does not require parliamentary approval for measures to come into effect, and parliament cannot veto measures (although the government is required to present the measures to parliament, and consult parliamentary committees before executing them). This is therefore coded 0 for all periods, as neither the ordinances or the Covid-19 act requires parliamentary approval for measures.

 The legislature did not approve the declaration or the extensions of the state of Emergency, as according to Section 172 of the Constitution of Thailand, it is not required by law.

In the case where it is necessary to extend such period, the 'Prime Minister upon the approval of the Council of Ministers shall have the power to declare the extension of duration of enforcement provided that each extension shall not exceed three months' (7).

*Comments*:
 The legislature has approved the declaration of public emergency on 27 March, and the extensions on 3 April. However, after the Parliament didn't approved another extension on 16 May, the president used an executive order to extend it. Furthermore, the second State of Public Emergency was declared and extended with executive orders and not approved by parliament. Therefore 'emlegapp' is coded as 0. The Public Health Act does not require approval by the Parliament.

*Comments*:
 Before the president's declaration of the state of emergency, on 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (1), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance, according to article 86 of the constitution.
The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.'' (4)

The definitive duration of each period should be decided by presidential decree, depending on how the pandemic evolves. The goal is to give some flexibility to measures taken in response to Covid-19; measures which, it should be noted, are taken at the council of ministers, based on the opinion of the constitutional court. 

Togo last extended the State of Health Emergency on 16 March 2021, to run through 16 September 2021. ''The decision was approved by the National Assembly after a request was submitted by PM Victoire Tomégah-Dogbé on 16 March 2021.''

*Comments*:
 All measures in Turkey were taken with administrative decisions generally in the form of presidential or ministerial circulars (legally atypical regulatory acts are almost at the bottom of the hierarchy of norms, and they cannot be contrary to laws and regulations. Typically, circulars are issued only for clarifying provisions of laws and regulations.) None of the decisions except one declared directly by the Presidency were published in the Official Gazette and most legal professionals, let alone ordinary citizens, would have a difficult time finding the original texts of these circulars and decisions.''

 The Statutory Instruments (Chapter 295 of the Public Health Act, sections 9, 28, 30, and 114) specified public health officials as the "authorized officers" to implement Covid-19 regulations and protocols. While the Ministry of Health initially led the response, in coordination with the WHO, the president appeared to have seized control by issuing a series of restrictions in March 2020 that have been amended at various points and continue through Q2 2021.

 The President does not need the approval of Parliament to declare a state of disaster, according to section 27 of the Civil Protection Act. The Parliament is merely informed that such declaration has been made. Section 28 of the Civil Protection Act states: "Where a state of disaster has been declared in terms of section twenty-seven, the Minister shall communicate such declaration to Parliament on the day that it next sits after the declaration is made."
