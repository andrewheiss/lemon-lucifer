 Q2 2020, Q3 2020: No information on instances of physical harrassment of journalists. 

Q4 2020: "On 11 and 12 December 2020, police assaulted and detained Ora News RTV journalist Xhoi Malësia and Kohan Jone newspaper’s editor in chief Qamil Xhani, while they were covering protests in Tirana against police violence. Street clashes erupted in the capital following the death of a 25-year-old man shot by police while enforcing a COVID-linked curfew on 8 December." (Council of Europe, 1) 

Q1 2021, Q2 2021: Since the cases in Q4 2020 took place in a short period of time in relation to a specific event and I found no further evidence of physical harassment of journalists, mephar is c0ded as 0.

 In April 2020, ''journalist Meriem Chorfi, along with two male journalists, was arrested and placed under judicial control by Algerian authorities on 2 April 2020 for their reporting on Covid-19. They were prosecuted on charges of “attack on national unity " and "dissemination of publications which may harm the national interest" on the basis of article 79 of the Penal Code.'' (1, 2). 

There are many more incidents of journalists being harassed by the authorities but these are not related to Covid-19.

 Reports of physical assault and detention of several journalists in Q2 2020. I have not found any new information in other time periods. Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 1: Journalist Sajal Bhuiyan was working on a report in the Narsingdi district on the rice crisis in Bangladesh amid the coronavirus pandemic. He was beaten up by an official and his supporter when trying to do his work. He sustained injuries to the head and eye and had to be warded in the hospital.

2: 15 journalists have been attacked in Bangladesh in the April and May for their reporting on COVID-19 issues.

I did not fine instances of the government or its agents physically harassing journalists due to reporting on Covid-19 in 2021. However, harassment of journalists in general in Bangladesh is rampant. Human Rights Watch reported that at least 247 were subjected to attacks, harrassment and intimidation by state officials in 2020. Since there is no evidence that the situation has improved, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 A journalist has been arrested and jailed for reporting on a Covid-19 death. This is however the only report found on physical harassment of journalists, and it does  not seem to be a recurring or systematic practice in relation to Covid-19 reporting. While journalists are facing grave verbal and physical harassment, these cases have not been in relation to Covid-19 or legitimized by them. Rather, such measures have been in relation to the Penal Code, which has been exacerbated after the Coup in 2021. Since this is not specifically on reporting on Covid-19, this is therefore coded as 0.

 No evidence was found, although journalists in CAR are frequently harassed and targeted by authorities when they publish information considered as a critique. 

''In August 2020 police briefly detained a journalist from the Association of Journalists for Human Rights radio station while she was investigating irregularities in the issuing of the national identification card. Also in August Henri Grothe, a blogger who resided in France and regularly criticized CAR authorities on social media, was briefly arrested and his passport confiscated upon his arrival at Bangui M’poko international airport. Grothe was released without any charge.'' (1)

 On 26 March 2020, journalist for state broadcaster Télé Tchad Aly Mahamat Bello, his cameraman Abakar Mahamad Seid and their driver were assaulted and then detained by the Chad Police Mobile Intervention Unit (GMIP) in the capital, N’Djamena, while reporting on government Covid-19 enforcement measures (coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings). The Union of Chadian Journalists said the three were interrogated for three hours before being released.'' (1, 2). 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021 ''Chadian authorities have stepped up restrictions on civic space in recent months with long internet shutdowns, arbitrary arrests, and violations of freedoms of protest and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said ahead of the 11 April 2021 presidential election.''

*Comments*:
 The media in China is very tightly controlled and multiple journalists have been jailed after reporting on various aspects of Covid-19.  For example, Zhang Zhan, a Chinese citizen journalist who covered Wuhan's Covid-19 outbreak was jailed for four years in December 2020. She was found guilty of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble". Reporters without Borders have also reported that harrassment of foreign correspondents in China intensified during Covid-19.

 According to interviews by Human Rights Watch, there were several incidents from March to July, during which the government or its agents used the state of emergency to harass and intimidate journalists, including those reporting about Covid-19 [1]. In particular, in March 2020, a reporter was chased by police and knocked from his motorcycle while reporting about the lockdown in Haut-Katanga province [2]. In May 2020, a radio journalist was arbitrarily arrested and held for three days on charges of violating Covid-19 restrictions [3]. Based on these incidents and the HRW report, we code Q2 and Q3 of 2020 as "1". No evidence was found that this continued after the state of emergency ended [4, 5, 6, 7].

In January 2021, "police forces detained Hamdi Atef Abdel Fattah, a 23-year-old student and reporter of Al-Naba, Al-Bayan, and Misr-Al-Bayan newspapers. The journalist was arrested for publishing a video on social media, where he showed the lack of oxygen of Covid-19 patients at Zefta General Hospital, located at Gharbia Governorate, in northern Egypt."

Amnesty International reports that journalists in Egypt regularly face harassment for critical reporting on the government's tackling of the pandemic. As such, I have coded all the time periods at 1.

 Greek police detained and attacked a Greek journalist, Antonis Rigopoulos, on 17 November 2020 while he was covering a rally in commemoration of the 1973 Polytechnic University student uprising against the military dictatorship. 

''As the journalist was documenting the arrest of protesters, he was approached by traffic police officers, and despite the fact that he was wearing a full gas mask, police tried to fine him €300 under Covid-19 regulations for not wearing a surgical mask. The officers then brought him to the headquarters of the Traffic Police where Rigopoulos claims they addressed him in a threatening and abusive manner in an attempt to provoke him. He later reported that one officer pushed him forcefully into a chair and shouted aggressively in his face. Rigopoulos added that officers repeatedly refused to acknowledge his journalistic ID and took his national ID off him for about half an hour.'' (1-4). 

Since December 2020 up to May 2021, there have been many incidents of police violence against journalists covering protests, but these were unrelated to Covid-19 reporting. (7)

 On 2 April 2020, several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards, while they were investigating claims that the office was violating Covid-19 guidelines by keeping applicants in close quarters, according to news reports and Robest Dimanche, one of the journalists, who spoke with CPJ in a phone interview. Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security.''

''In April 2020, a protest broke out in the capital of Haiti after the arrestation of Mr. Louko Desir, a Journalist and the host of Matin Debat at Radio Télé Eclair.

From some reports, he was released from jail hours later. '' (2) 

Also in April 2020, ''A reporter for Radio Television Caribbean, Georges Allen was beaten and arrested by a police patrol for allegedly violating a government imposed curfew, despite the journalists showing his credentials that exempt him from the curfew regulations.'' 

The curfew was still ongoing in Q4 of 2020, Q1 of 2021 and Q2 of 2021. No more incidents were found after Q2 2020.

 There are several cases of physical harassment of journalist in Hong Kong, but no such cases have been found in relation to them reporting on Covid-19. Rather, such harassment seem to be related to quelling the pro-democracy movement, and the measures have been taken under the non-Covid-19 related National Security Law. This is therefore coded 0.

 According to the U.S. Dept of State, "There were numerous instances of journalists and members of media organizations reportedly being threatened or killed in response to their reporting." RSF adds "In 2020, the government took advantage of the coronavirus crisis to step up its control of news coverage by prosecuting journalists providing information at variance with the official position." HRW adds, "Several journalists faced criminal cases, arrest, threat, or even physical assault by mobs or police for reporting on Covid-19. In many cases, they were independent journalists working in rural India, targeted for their criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic." Examples include:

1: In the western state of Gujarat, Dhaval Patel, the editor of the Face of Nation news website, was arrested on 11 May 2020 for sedition under Section 124A of the penal code over an article he wrote four days before suggesting that India’s ruling BJP could replace Vijay Rupani as Gujarat chief minister because the surge in coronavirus cases in the state. His lawyer said Patel was held in jail for 72 hours before finally being taken before a judge and charged.

2: Manish Pandey, a journalist with the Hindi-language TV news channel News1 India, was questioned at length by police in Lucknow, on 1 May 2020 about a story two weeks before reporting that medical professionals had complained about the quality of the personal protective equipment provided to hospitals and universities. Pandey said the police tried to pressure him into naming his sources.

3: From 01 April 2020 to 15 May 2020, editor of The Wire, Siddharth Varadarajan, was detained after he tweeting a report about the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh insisting on religious gatherings despite Covid-19.  

4: On 19 May 2020 the West Bengal government stopped the broadcast of a Bengali news channel that was questioning the state government's response to the pandemic, including underreporting cases and deaths. 

5: On 13 May 2021 a TV journalist was arrested in Manipur for reporting about the death of the BJP president due to Covid-19 and criticizing the government's response to the pandemic.

 Several journalists have been arrested and detained due to reporting on Covid-19 in Iran. Many of these (if not all) are still detained it seems, clearly constituting a physical harassment for their reporting in relation to Covid-19 in the following periods as well. Iran’s general infringement of media has also continued over the other periods, although no direct evidence has been found of further assaults or detentions. However, as these detentions seem to be ongoing, and no indications are given that the situation in Iran is improving, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

 There are several cases where journalists have been arrested and detained when trying to report on Covid-19 in Iraq. In Q2 of 2020, several journalists were detained and arrested for trying to cover authorities handling of Covid-19. In November 2020, journalists (and bloggers) have been targeted with defamation complaints by the government for investigating and reporting on Covid-19 cases and deaths (note also that there is several cases of harassment for reporting on other issues, primarily government protests). In February 2021, three reporters were sentenced to several years in prison for having reported on protests against the governments handling of Covid-19 and its economic consequences. The Iraqi authorities, and especially it seems, the Kurdish region, have continuously physically harassed journalists through various arrests and detentions. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

Likewise, some journalists received physical abuse when reporting on Covid-19 issues in areas largely populated by Ultra-Orthodox groups, but this harassment came from residents and not authorities.

 Reports of arrests of journalists covering government's response to the pandemic:  "Kazak authorities arrest two KTK TV journalists reporting on hospital working conditions on April 11, 2020. Police in the western city of Atyrau arrested journalist Beken Alirakhimov and cameraman Manas Sharipov of KTK TV as they were interviewing doctors and reporting on working conditions at a hospital in the city. The pair were charged with “violating the state of emergency” under Article 476 of the Administrative Code. They were found guilty on April 24 and were placed under forced quarantine for two weeks in hospital." (IPI, 1)  Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 'Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya, ARTICLE 19 identified that there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1)

''Although journalists were listed as essential service workers and exempted from curfew restrictions, reports indicate that on-duty journalists were harassed. At least 10 journalists and digital content creators have been arrested or threatened with prosecution under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act 2018. They were accused of publishing and spreading false and alarming information on social media about the new coronavirus. At least 10 others were arrested under the Public Order Act, for allegedly flouting the curfew.'' (2) 

''On 4 April 2021, police beat and arrested David Omurunga, a journalist with Milele FM radio at around 8.10pm, while he was walking home from work. Despite him presenting his identification card including official press card, the officers assaulted him and bundled into a waiting police van for violating 8pm to 4am curfew protocols. Journalists are listed as essential service providers and therefore are allowed under ordinary circumstances to operate outside curfew time. According to David Omurunga, the police confiscated his video and voice recorder and both his national identification and press card. He filed a complaint report with the police at Nakuru police station, Omurunga told ARTICLE 19 Eastern Africa that he was yet to receive any report of his case even after making several follow ups at the station. He also yet to receive back his press card and his equipment.'' (10) 

There are many more attacks on journalists but unrelated to the pandemic.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any verbal harassment of journalists in Lebanon, and no other indications have been found of there having been any such harassment. However, there is reports of journalists being physically harassed by government agents in relation to government protests after the Beirut explosion in August 2020. This is coded 0 as these protest, and the enforcement, has no connection to Covid-19 and the measures taken does not reference Covid-19 to the extent I have seen.

 No reports of journalists being physically harassed while reporting about Covid-19. However, in November 2020, several reporters were detained and one was shot while covering a youth movement protest. Police justified their actions under Covid-19 restrictions on gatherings.

On 30 March 2020, a radio director was attacked by officers as he tried to report live on a group of officers enforcing social distancing.

Bouzouma, who is also the correspondent of the news website Alakhbar.info in Zouerate, was released after spending 12 days in detention.

On 2 June 2020, the police arrested Salma Mint Tolba, the alleged author of a series of audio recordings questioning aspects of the government's response to the Covid-19. Notably, she accused the authorities of inflating the number of infections. Two other people, Mohamed Ould Semmane and Sidi Mohamed Ould Beyah, who were suspected to have participated in the dissemination of the audio, were also arrested.'' (1)

 Citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28 March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on Covid-19. The situation of those detained and imprisoned are being monitored by rights groups.
Human rights groups have called for the release of those freely expressing their opinion, including the release of journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement to all African countries, including Morocco, where four journalists are imprisoned and called for the release of jailed journalists and to protect the free press and the free flow of information at this crucial time.'' (1)

Also, a Moroccan citizen journalist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was charged on 17 May 2020 by the prosecutor of the Court of First Instance in Laayoune with "breaking orders related to the health emergency status",based on the health emergency Decree law passed in March 2020, and with "offending public officials", based on article 263of the penal code. The trial was postponed for the end of September 2020. (2)

“On 5 May 2020, local representatives of the Ministry of Interior in Tiflet reportedly assaulted two journalists while they were covering the Covid-19 lockdown’s impact on local market activity during Ramadan on behalf of a national Amazigh television station. Media reports indicated the officials verbally assaulted a female journalist before slapping her and pushing her to the ground, while her accompanying cameraman sustained a hand injury as he tried to prevent the authorities from confiscating his camera.” (6) 

In addition, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since 21 November 2020. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its Covid-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (3) 

No more incidents were found during Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 Journalists covering covid-19 related issues have been physically attacked by police. On 03 August a journalist was attacked by police forces while covering officers' enforcing COVID-19 restrictions. On 24 October, a journalist was arrested after conducting "interviews in the north Lagos suburb of Agege, where residents had massed outside a government warehouse with the aim of taking food they believed to be stored here for alleviating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic" (1), and a week later he was found dead with a gunshot on his body. According to RSF, “Nigeria is now one of West Africa’s most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists, who are often spied on, attacked, arbitrarily arrested or even killed” (1). Since there were several violations and assaults on journalists are common, violations likely continue and mephar is coded as 1 in all periods.

*Comments*:
 I did not find any information related to this. However there is complete control over communication within North Korea. Citizens can also be sent to concentration camps for looking at online media. The Korean Central News Agency is the only permitted source of news within the country. These factors may deter journalists from being critical in their reporting. Furthermore, the restricted nature of news may mean that harrassment could be happening without credible reports of such occurances.

 Pawel Rutkiewicz, a reporter working for Gazeta Wyborcza was detained when covering anti-lockdown demonstrations on 29 March 2020, despite showing his press pass.  Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

*Comments*:
 Particularly during Q2 of 2020, several journalists have been arrested in Rwanda: 

''Police in Rwanda, in April 2020, arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s Covid-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.'' (1). 

In March and April 2020, six bloggers were arrested in Rwanda for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.'' (2, 3). 

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.'' (4) 

''On 9 February 2021, Innocent Bahati, a 31-year-old singer and poet, was reported missing to the Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB), two days after he was last seen in Nyanza, Southern Province. His poems, which he recites in videos posted on YouTube, have focused on social issues such as growing poverty or criticism of the lockdown and its impact. Two people who saw him before he disappeared told Human Rights Watch that he had traveled to Nyanza district on 7 February 2021 to research material for a new poem. The RIB spokesperson told the media an investigation into his whereabouts was ongoing.'' (5).

 Activists and bloggers have been arrested and harrassed against the principle of freedom of expression, for criticizing the government response, but not journalists.
On 13 April Tunisian police raided the Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) news agency "to enforce appointment of pro-government director" [6] by the Tunisian HoG Hichem Mechichi, who removed journalist Mouna Mtibaa as the TAP director on 5 April. It is not clear that this was in response to reporting on COVID-19.

However, these reports are only from Q2 of 2020, and no later reports of such arrests related to Covid-19 has been found (although journalists in Turkey are subject to arrests that are not related to Covid-19 throughout the period). This is therefore coded 1 for Q2 of 2020, and 0 for the other periods.

*Comments*:
 Throughout 2020 and 2021, security forces harassed and assaulted journalists while enforcing Covid-19 protocols [1,2,3,4], despite the press being exempt from many of these measures as essential workers [5]. At least 12 cases of assault was reported between just March 19 (beginning of lockdown) and April 24, 2020. Journalists have been beaten, slapped, punched, kicked, and had their camera taken and forced to delete pictures, when reporting on police enforcing lockdown measures [5,6,7,8]. Harassment of journalists before and after national elections in January 2021 supposedly for pandemic response has been widespread [9]. There is no sign of improvement.

 The police aggressively pushed and broke camera equipment of a journalist reporting on anti-lockdown protests on 29 April 2020. Since cases of physical harassment of journalists are monitored by various sources (Council of Europe, IPI, CPJ) on a case by case bases, lack of information likely means that there were no further cases of physical harrassment.

 No instances of physical harassment of reporters covering Covid-19 has been found, and this is therefore coded 0. Note that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests and election protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19. Some later reports of physical harassment of members of the press from law enforcement has been found, but this is not in relation to Covid-19 and thus not accounted for here. There are also several occurrences of violence toward journalists by protesters, but these are not related to Covid-19 measures either. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.
