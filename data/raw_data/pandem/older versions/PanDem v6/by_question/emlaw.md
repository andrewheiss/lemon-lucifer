 In dealing with Covid-19, the state has imposed lockdowns in Afghanistan. This has been done on a provincial level. The lockdown of at least three weeks was first imposed in Kabul on 28 March 2020.On 6 June 2020, the Government of Afghanistan announced that it was extending it's nationwide lockdown for three more months until the end of August 2020.

There have been no additional lockdowns since August 2020.


As of May 7 2021, the COVID-19-related restrictions in force in Afghanistan remain largely unchanged by comparison with those in place during the first week of April 2021.

 Q2 2020: state of natural disaster; based on the Constitution, emergency measures can be taken during a state of war, state of emergency or natural disaster  (Art 170 (1)). State of natural disaster is different from state of emergency. According to Art 174 (1) of the Constitution, "for the prevention or the avoidance of the consequences of natural disasters or technological accidents, the Council of Ministers may decide on the state of natural disaster for a period not longer than 30 days, in one part or in the whole territory of the state." [2]; According to OSCE report, "state of Natural Disaster, different from a “state of emergency”, declared by the Council of Minister on 24 March, later extended upon the consent of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania, as per Art.s 170-175 of the Constitution, and ended on 23 June." [1]

Q3 2020:  the primary legal instrument for this time period is Constitution (Article 101) that was used to declare Normative Act no. 3, dated 15.3.2020 and that was amended several times (e.g. the Normative Act no. 30, dated 20.07.2020 “On some amendments and additions to the Normative Act no. 3, dated 15.3.2020, of the Council of Ministers")

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021:  The legal instrument in these periods is Law No.15/2016 "For the prevention and fighting infections and infectious diseases" 
January-March 2021: Order 809 from 10.02.2021  based on the Law No.15/2016 "For the prevention and fighting infections and infectious diseases" (LIGJ Nr. 15/2016 PËR PARANDALIMIN DHE LUFTIMIN E INFEKSIONEVE DHE SËMUNDJEVE INFEKTIVE). It was first used to declare a curfew  in November 2020 (Order 616 from 09.11.2020 from the Minister of Health), which was extended indefiitely on 02.12.2020 (Order 660 from the Minister of Health). The same legal instrument was used to amend the hours of the curfew (Order 681 from 21.12.2020, order 99 from 10.02.2021).

*Comments*:
 Algeria adopted several gradual measures through Decrees. The decrees are based: 
a) on the Constitution (1), and in particular on articles 99 (4) and 143 (1) - relating to Head of State Decree powers, and 
b) the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 du 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail (4).  

The government gradually took a series of general measures that have been the subject of two main texts: 
a) Executive Decree No. 20-69 of 21 March 2020 (2) relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Covid-19; 
b) Executive Decree No. 20-70 of 24 March 2020 (3) establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Covid-19 such as restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.'' (see 5, 6). 

The Algerian Government has been using the same legal instruments in order to issue regulations in forms of Executive Decrees to deal with Covid-19 throughout (see: a list of decrees up to January 2021: 7, 8, decrees during Q1 and Q2 of 2021: 9, 10, 11).

 Australia has nationally declared a Human Biosecurity Emergency on 2020-03-18.
This is a specific legal instrument that is separate from the Disaster and Emergency Management Act, and this is thus coded as 2, i.e. a public health emergency.
It is still in force, having been extended four times with a current end date at 2021-09-17.

*Comments*:
 Austria has a state of emergency legislation, but this has not been used. Instead, Austria have implemented a number of new laws (e.g. Covid-19 Law, Second Covid-19 Law and then subsequent legislation for the reopening of Austria, as well as a larger amendment of the Covid-19 Law on September 26 2020) within the existing legal framework, and based primarily on the Epidemics Act. These amendments have continued over the year, and they have also issued legislation of gradual re-opening which will come into effect on 2021-05-18. Through the new laws, the government has been given an extraordinary set of powers to address Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 4. Worth noting is that the current primary legal instrument for taking measures on Covid-19 is the ”COVID-19 Emergency Measures Act - COVID-19-MG”.

 A special quarantine regime but not a state of emergency declared by the Cabinet of Ministers on 24 March 2020 and is in place at the time of coding. Under the special quarantine regime, initially people over 65 years old were prohibited from leaving home and assembly of more than 10 people was prohibited. According to OSCE report, Azerbaijan is among countries that "mainly relied on existing sanitation, health safety and/or disaster legislation that gives the authority to put in place restrictive measures."

*Comments*:
 Bangladesh did not declare a state of emergency. It instead declared a country-wide "general holiday", which was imposed for two weeks from 26 March. This was later extended until 5 May, then extended to 16 May and finally 30 May 2020. The scope of the "general holiday" was extensive with the closure of all government and private offices, schools and universities and subject to stringent exceptions, all courts including the Supreme Court. 

Whenever any new COVID-19 case is detected, the concerned suburb, village or district is placed under "lockdown" which is often done by an oral administrative order, so it is possible to have both a "public holiday" and also a "lockdown" as emergency measures taken at  the same time.

The state imposed a lockdown which lasted from 7 April 2021 to 28 April 2021. However, this was not in reference to a specific legal instrument.

 No state of emergency declared and the measures included: Resolution of the Council of Ministers 208 from 8 April 2020 that resticted people in self-isolation from leaving their home and Resolution of the Council of Ministers 171 from 25 March 2020 (amended on 24 April 2020, 26 June 2020) establishing rules for transport operators and people arriving from certain foreign countries (the list of countries that do not require self-isolation was last amended on 11 June 2020). On 24 April, the President signed a decree introducing measures to support the economy. According to OSCE report, such regulations are of "rather limited scope" (1). According to OECD, Belarus has introduced only some containment measures and no "comprehensive containment measures" (2).  Nevertheless, I coded them as part of the emergency response similar to International IDEA.

*Comments*:
 Most of the restrictive measures taken by the Belgian federal government in response to Covid-19 were taken by Ministerial Decrees. These decrees are signed by one minister, authorized by the government, and are usually meant to cover secondary and complementary measures. The legal basis for these decrees lies in the process of Special Powers Laws and Decrees as indicated by Article 105 of the Belgian Constitution, which gives special powers to the executive. Further, the Ministerial Decrees also find their legal basis in a Law on Civil Security of 2007 (16), assigning competence to the Minister of Home Affairs in case of imminent circumstances.  

Belgium invoked Article 105 of the Constitution that gives Special powers to the executive in order to pass legislation dealing with Covid-19 (1; 2; 3). On 27 March 2020 the adoption of the Special Powers Act took place, with two enabling Covid-19 laws: Article 3 of Law Covid-19 (I) (No 1104/5), and Article 5 of Law Covid-19 (II) (No 1104/6) (see 5, 6). The Special Powers Act was due to expire (and expired) on 30 June 2020 (10).

Based on the authorization of the Special Powers Act, the Belgian government passed several Decrees containing a package of measures (for a full list see (4)).
However, the first strict measures limitting civil liberties and fundamental rights was passed before the Special Powers Act. In fact, the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 that included the most strict provisions was taken 4 days earlier, and while it provided that the measures adopted were only applicable until 5 April 2020, it has been amended several times to extend this deadline and has formed the basis of all consequent decrees (see 7, 8). 

''After the two special powers laws of 27 March 2020 expired on 30 June 2020, the Belgian government, although it could and should have adopted a new law on special powers, it did not do so. Since Belgium is a federal state, the federated authorities - the regions and communities - can logically also make use of special powers, which most of them have done. The nature and extent of the special powers granted by the legislators of these federated entities are quite variable when compared to each other but also when compared to federal laws of special powers, some special powers resembling full powers. (8) 

The government, on 30 June 2020, issued another Ministerial Decree ''portant des mesures d’urgence pour limiter la propagation du coronavirus Covid-19 (11), which was being used and continuously updated to deal with Covid-19 during Q3 of 2020. This Order had an initial limit date until 31 August 2020.

In order for the Belgian federal government to continue legislating on Covid-19 matters, the Order of 30 June 2020 (with an end date on 31 August 2020) was amended by Ministrial Order of 18 October 2020 (12), with an initial limit date of 19 November 2020. 

On 28 October 2020, the Federal Governemnt issued a new Ministrial Order (13) which replaced the Order of 18 October 2020. This Order was used and was being updated regularly up to 7 May 2021. (see also (14)). 

''The Belgian Covid-19 response has been widely criticized for its lack of a sufficient legal basis and parliamentary involvement. In January 2021, ten months after the start of the first lockdown, the government finally introduced a ‘Pandemiewet’ (Pandemic law (15)), to serve as a legal basis for this and all following pandemics. (14) 

The Pandemic Law has not been approved by Parliament as of 17 May 2021; it passed its first hearing on 7 May 2021 (17).

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually without a specific reference to a legal instrument (see 1 for a full list of Government Orders, see also 2 - 4). 
Measures were taken at the Council of Ministers signed by the Minister of Interior. The first 11 measures on 17 March 2020 (2, 3) were general in nature and applied to the national level. The more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the Covid-19 health cordon (4), applied to the affected areas. Coded as 6 for Q2 2020 because the health codron, i.e. the strictest measure in place, did not apply to the whole territory (hence no national level response), and 5 for the remaining quarters since the measures were nationwide. 

The health cordon (3) was established on 23 March 2020 to count from 30 March 2020 around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 
On 14 April 2020, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).

On 11 May 2020 the government lifted the health cordon (5). Face masks became mandatory. 
Benin has maintained some restrictions in place throughout Q1 and Q2 of 2021 like the mandatory wearing of masks, regular hand washing with soap and water or the use of hydroalcoholic solution, maintaining the health safety distance at least one meter between people (see 6-10).

*Comments*:
 The Decree nº 4196 from March 17, 2020, declared a sanitary emergency and defined restrictive measures, so it most closely resembles a state of exception. The Decree nº 4179 from March 12, 2020, declared a state of emergency, but for fiscal and economic reasons. Once a sanitary emergency was lifted, other measures were established (via Decrees n º 4404, 4430, 4443, 4451, 4464, 4466, and 4473)  to control the pandemic based on the "Law for the Prevention, Containment and Treatment of Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)".

*Comments*:
 The Burkinabe Council declared a state of health alert (2) in accordance with article 66 of the Public Health Code (1) (1994) through a press release on 26 March 2020. The decree no 2020- 0215 was also issued (3) establishing:
a) a two-week quarantine (starting on 27 March 2020) in the cities of Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Boromo, Houndé, Dédougou, Banfora, Manga and Zorgho, and  to be extended to any city where a positive Covid-19 case will occur.
b) a two week extension of the closure of all school facilities and activities throughout the national territory. The recovery date is set for 14 April 2020 but could see a rearrangement depending on the evolution of the epidemic.

However, there had been several concerns raised over the legitimation and legal basis of the government's state of health alert (see 4, 5):
a) the state of health alert had not been issued through a decree, nor did it have a limit date (only the separate measures do) (5). 
b) the decree establishing the curfew has no legal basis, since it only vaguely refers to the Constitution, and the curfew was not instituted with reference to  the state of health alert. 
c) critics point to the non-existent source in the public health code of the measures restricting rights and freedoms taken by the authorities within the framework of the state of health alert: the public health code article cited (66) only allows for measures of a sanitary nature (hygiene and prophylaxis), and not for a curfew etc.

Yet, although the government was lacking a clear legal basis for the above measures, and it had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the Covid-19 measures, during the Council of Ministers on 16 April 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill for an enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see 7, 8). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law. The ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after consulting the Constitutional Council. They come into force as soon as they are published, but become null and void if the ratification bill is not submitted to the National Assembly before the date set by the enabling law. At the end of the period mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the ordinances can only be modified by law in those of their provisions which are in the legislative domain."

The bill on the enabling law providing the government with the legal basis to take urgent Covid-19 actions within three months was voted on 5 May 2020 by the National Assembly (see 9) (Law no 015-2020/AN). 
No evidence was found on whether the law was extended after the 3 months (i.e. after August 2020) limit-period. The curfew was lifted on 3 June 2020.  
Measures taken after that date are more general in nature, like the mandatory wearing of face masks. These minimal restrictions are in place as of June 2021 (12). 

In Q1 and Q2 2021, while no Covid-19-related curfews remain in effect, security-related curfews and associated states of emergency not connected with disease activity are still in force in the Est, Sahel, Boucle de Mouhoun, Nord, Haut-Bassins, and Centre-Est regions (13).

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has a state of emergency legislation in the constitution (Chapter XI), but this has not been used. Maynmar has however had a national level emergency response, for example closing borders, imposing curfews and restricting gatherings. Myanmar has continued to issue such measurements during the fall of 2020, such as stay at home orders in some townships and extending flight bans. The legal basis for these measures are varying and often unclear. Some measures have been taken with reference to Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law – whereas others have been taken without any reference (for instance, many of the early announcements of restrictions and limiting public gatherings held no reference to legal instruments – and the extension of these refer back to those initial announcements). The Myanmar Parliament also amended the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases in May, and it seems to be used for some aspects of dealing with the pandemic. At the same time, people who have been charged with violating restrictions have been charged under several different penal codes, with varying penalties in relation to the same crimes, again indicating that there is no one or main legal instrument used to deal with Covid-19. Therefore, for Q2-Q4 in 2020 this is coded as 5 – a national level emergency response without specific reference to a legal instrument. 
On February 1 2021, a military coup displaced the government. The new government also imposed a year-long state of emergency, but not in relation to Covid-19. Multiple sources contend that since the military coup, the restrictions have mostly been kept in place, although most of them have not been confirmed or enacted anew under the new government (for instance, the U.S. embassy states that much of the restrictions have not formally been announced again since the coup, and restrictions can change without formal notice). Thus, the exact restrictions in place are somewhat unclear in Myanmar, but in general the restrictions remain as they were before the coup (Garda for instance mentions that the restriction of no more than 30 people gathering remains as of early May 2021, and have also continuously reported that restrictions have remained in place since the coup). Since the measures and restrictions seem to be the same before and after the coup, and no reference to legal instruments has been found, this is coded as 5 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

 Burundi has taken a few measures to combat Covid-19, without any specific reference to legal instruments. The main measures were announced on 12 March 2020 and 16 March 2020 (1, 2). 

The government suspended all inbound and outbound passenger flights and social distancing and masks are encouraged but not enforced. There was no national lockdown. 
The measures still in place throughout the pandemic include social distancing and the use of facemasks, which are encouraged.

*Comments*:
 The Cambodian government introduced a state of emergency law which was passed on 29 April 2020. An official state of emergency was never declared. However, the laws passed through can still be enacted. Article 22 on the constitution states 'When the nation faces danger, the King shall make a public proclamation placing the country in a state of emergency, after unanimous agreement from the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate."

On 11 March 2021, Law on Measures to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 and other Serious, Dangerous and Contagious Diseases went in force, which is different from differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe and is coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister of Cameroon announced with a Special declaration on 17 March 2020 (1), a total of thirteen measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The measures were gradually eased starting June 2020.

The measures were not based on a legal instrument, nor were issued through a decree. The authorities continue to have similar measures in place as of June 2021 (see 8). 

According to legal experts (2), ''In Cameroon, emergency law is solely the prerogative of the President of the Republic. He alone can declare a state of emergency “when circumstances so warrant”... (Art. 9 Constitution). So far, Cameroon’s government has not declared a state of emergency.
''Instead, Cameroon has chosen to base the fight against Covid-19 on its existing legal framework. The fight against Covid-19 is a public health issue which, according to Cameroonian law, is a component of public order. The protection of public order is the responsibility of executive authorities, which have the power to adopt any executive orders for its preservation. As of now, all the measures taken in the context of the fight against Covid-19 are administrative measures, but as we shall see, they have different legal qualities and force.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 Canada has a state of emergency legislation, the Emergency Act, but this has not been activated. Instead, the government uses existing legal framework such as the Quarantine Act, Human Pathogen and Toxins Act, Public Health Act and Public Health Agency of Canada Act to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Furthermore, they have approved laws relating to Covid-19 (Covid-19 Emergency Response Act 1 and 2) but these are not emergency measures that affect any democratic rights, but rather provide financial aid to different sectors and groups. The Canadian government has also implemented national border restrictions and quarantine of foreign nationals entering Canada. Beyond that aspect, though, the emergency response, and declarations of states of emergency, have instead been conducted more or less entirely at the provincial level. Therefore, this is coded as 6, i.e. they have no national level emergency response because that response is handled by the provinces.

*Comments*:
 Central African Republic took a series of gradual measures, without a specific reference to a legal instrument. The measures were announced through Press Releases. These minimal measures remain in place as of May 2021. 

''It was also highlighted that the Government seemed to refer to the Constitution primarily for electoral purposes instead of invoking it for addressing the country's urgent needs due to the disastrous impact of Covid-19.  The Constitution indeed authorises the President to declare a state of emergency or use 'exceptional powers' in exceptional circumstances. Declaring a state of emergency would have allowed the National Assembly to enact a public health emergency law to address the effects of the pandemic. However, the government did not make use of these provisions - or any specific law - as a basis for the de facto emergency measures that it imposed on the population.'' 

Due to the security situation and the existence of rebel groups, a state of emergency was proclaimed on 21 January 2021 (extended until August 2021). A curfew is in force throughout the country, from 8 pm to 5 am. This is not related to the pandemic.

 Authorities in Chad have been using Articles 96, 97, 127, 130 of the Constitution (2018) to legislate on Covid-19 issues and declare a state of health emergency. (1)
Order 044 of 1962 on the state of emergency (Ordonnance n° 44 du 27 octobre 1962 relative à l'état d'urgence).
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted. 

The state of health emergency in Chad is still in place and was last extended through 11 September 2021, after consecutive extensions and it has never been lifted (8).

*Comments*:
 China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures a region will implement, with level 1 the most serious. Officials in the different regions are separately in charge of their own areas. The emergency response law is triggered when the region goes into level 1. However, the measures that can be taken according to the emergency response law is very vague [3]. These laws have been enacted since January 2020.

I have not found evidence of the Chinese government triggering the emergency response law in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 Croatia did not declare a state of emergency or disaster, and instead used existing legislation (the Civil Protection Act, the Law on Prevention of Infectious Diseases) to implement emergency measures, announced by decisions of the Civil Protection Authority. The first measures under this legal instrument are from 19 March 2020. The same legal instrument was used for all time periods (for example, March-June 2020: decision to limit social gatherings from 19 March , July-September 2020: decision to limit the working hours of night clubs from 10 July, October-December: decision on restricting social gatherings from 25 October, January-March, April-June 2021: many restrictions are still in place. Currently, it is supposed to last through 31 May and determines e.g. that gatherings of more than 25 people are forbidden, and the commerce of alcohol is prohibited between 22-6h. The government argues that from 1 June the measures could be relaxed).

 March-June 2020 : On 12 March, the authorities declared a state of emergency from 13 March 2020 for 30 days. 

July-September 2020: the measures during this period were passed using Zákon č. 258/2000 Sb. "Zákon o ochraně veřejného zdraví a o změně některých souvisejících zákonů" (Act No. 258/2000 Coll., on Public Health Protection and the amendment to certain related acts). The same legislation was used in March prior to the state of emergency. This legislation allows the Minister of Health to make decisions on "prohibition or limitation of contact of groups of natural persons suspected of being infected with other natural persons" (such as banning mass gatherings) ( Section 80(1)(g), Section 69(1)(b) and (2)) (1)

October-December 2020, January-March 2021: state of emergency declared from 5 October and extended several times (normally by 30 days periods). In February a new law for the pandemics is created, but only activated with the lifting of the state of emergency in April. 

April-June 2021: with the Pandemic Act, the state of pandemic alert entered into force. Some restrictions are maintained and are being eased gradually.

 DRC President HE Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo decreed by ordinance (n° 20/014) (2), on 24 March 2020 the state of health emergency to face the Covid-19 pandemic.
The state of health emergency was in accordance to the Constitution (1): articles 85, 86, 144, 145 (provisions on a state of emergency). The state of emergency was lifted on 22 July 2020. 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

After the lifting of the state of emergency, during Q3 and half of Q4 of 2020, there were social distancing measures in place and a mandatory wearing of face masks that applied nationwide, but these were taken under ''normal'' law-making powers (hence coding is 5). 

However, due a surge in Covid-19 cases, in 17 December 2020 President Félix Tshisekedi decreed an indefinite 2100-0500 curfew effective 18 December 2020 across the country. In addition to the curfew, barrier gestures (compulsory wearing of masks, physical distancing, regular hand washing and temperature measurement) were also ordered (7, 8).
The nationwide curfew was decreed with Arrete Ministeriel no25/032/2020 of 17 December 2020 (see 9 - 12), an was based on ''normal'' law-making powers and Constitution provisions that mainly originate from the Ministry of Interior. The references to the Constitution are vague, and there’s no direct reference to a specific legal instrument allowing the Ministry to declare these measures (hence coding is 5). 

On 14 April 2021, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi announced the easing of the curfew in some provinces, including the capital Kinshasa, and its complete lifting in others where the circulation of the virus was low. 
In other provinces including the city of Kinshasa, North - Kivu (east), Kongo Central (South - West), Lualaba (South - east), Haut - Katanga (South - east) and South - Kivu (east) where the epidemic curve is downward, the curfew in effect since December 2020 was pushed back to 10 pm until 4 am (13). 

A curfew is still in effect from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. in some provinces including Kinshasa as of June 2021 (14).

*Comments*:
 The Danish government proposed an amedment to the Act on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Epidemiloven) that grants the Minister of Health powers that include limiting gatherings of people, prohibiting access to means of transportation and order people who are suspected of being infected to isolate. This amendment is the legal instrument through which the initial emergency measures were taken, and this is therefore coded as 4. The amendment had a sunset clause set to a year, from 2020-03-01 to 2021-03-01. When this amendment expired, it was replaced with a permanent Epidemic Act (in danish also called Epidemiloven) that was prepared and debated in parliament during the fall and winter of 2020. This new and permanent Epidemic Act includes most of possible measures and powers of the temporary amendment, but due to the permanent nature also includes much more parliamentary oversight, veto rights and judicial review of actions taken, and especially so for the more intervening measures. Thus, the new epidemics act solidifies the Danish authorities powers to take measures to mitigate Covid-19 (and other similar diseases) spread if considered to have devastating enough effect on health and society, but it distributes the power of this act to more instances than the government, as well as introduces checks and balances onto the measures taken. Thus, the legal instrument changed as of Q2 in 2021, but it is still a new legislation not representing any state of emergency and thus coded 4 here as well.

 A state of emergency was declared via the Presidential Decree nº 1017, from March 16 and it was extended three times. After the third extension, the Constitutional Court announced that another extension would not be accepted, so the state of emergency ended in September. Once it expired, it was replaced by a set of mandatory guidelines without specific reference to legal instruments. President Lenín Moreno declared a new state of exception on December 21 via the Presidential Decree nº 1217, but the Constitutional Court declared it unconstitutional. Then, a focused state of emergency was declared on April 1, 2021, for 30 days (Presidential Decree nº 1282). However, the Constitutional Court declared it could only be valid until April 9, since elections were held on April 11. Another focused state of emergency was declared between April 23 and May 20, 2021 (Presidential Decree nº 1291). These focused state of emergencies only applied to certain provinces with higher number of cases.

 Egypt has been under a nationwide state of emergency since April 2017. It was extended for the 12th time on 28 April 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On 22 April 2020, amendments were made to the 1958 Emergency Law (No. 162/1958) which gives sweeping powers to the president and security agencies. The state of emergency has been extended regularly every three months. It was last extended on 25 April 2021 and it will last till 25 July 2021.

 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15. Once the state of emergency was lifted, the president declared the implementation of sanitary barriers in cities with a high number of cases, without specific reference to legal instruments. The National Assembly argued that these were "military barriers", not sanitary, and in late October they issued a decree prohibiting the establishment of such barriers without approval of the mayor and prohibiting "intimidating and coercive use of the Armed Forces". After that, no other emergency measures were implemented.

 The Finish Government declared a state of emergency unde the Emergency Powers Act on March 16 2020, which was terminated on June 16 2020. Since then, Finland has used existing legislation to take measures against Covid-19. The primary legal instrument, since the end of the State of Emergency, is the Communicable Diseases Act, for which some amendments related to handling the pandemic has also been passed by parliament. This is therefore coded as 1 in the Q2 of 2020, and 4 in the other periods.

 On 23 March 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a health state of emergency, initially declared for a period of two months from 24 March 2020 to 24 May 2020, and extended until 10 July 2020, when it was lifted (Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 - The “Emergency Law”) (6). 

On 11 July 2020 a new law came into effect (LOI n° 2020-856 du 9 juillet 2020 (9)) that outlined the conditions for lifting  the state of health emergency and organizing the transition  period. This law contained several restrictions on civil liberties such as that the Prime Minister could still be allowed to regulate gatherings and movement, and to close establishments. This law was brought before the Constitutional Council, which ruled the Law was according to the Constitution, but noted that the powers of the PM to regulate or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles under certain conditions can only be pronounced for the period from 11 July 2020 to 30 October 2020 and only in areas with a high circulation of  the  virus, and cannot prohibit people from leaving their homes. (8).

On  14 October 2020, the health state of emergency was reinstated in France (10), based on the Public Health Code and through the Decree No.2020-1257 that indicates that the Covid-19 epidemic constitutes a health crisis in France (8). The Decree n ° 2020-1262 of 16 October 2020 was then issued, prescribing the general measures necessary to deal with the epidemic of Covid-19 within the framework of the state of health emergency (11). 

Although the French Constitution (1958) and primary law deals with emergency situations by virtue of three sets of provisions: (i) 'presidential exceptional powers' (Article 16 of the Constitution), ii) the 'state of siege' (Article 36 of the Constitution and Article L. 2121-1 of the Defence Code),  and iii) the 'state of emergency' (Law No 55-385 of 1955)), the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 is new legislation. 
This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code (8), allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''
The new Emergency Law is temporary, and it is due to expire entirely by 1 April 2021. It also needs the approval of the legislature if it is going to be implemented for more than 1 month.

''These provisions supplement a preexisting article of the Public Health Code, article 3131-1, which allows the minister of health to order “any measure proportionate to the risks and appropriate to the circumstances … to prevent and limit the consequences” of a serious health threat to the population. This provision was considered inadequate on its own to deal with a crisis such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, as it placed almost the entire burden of the response on the minister of health. The new provisions, by contrast, are meant to create a more solid and comprehensive framework that involves the entire government.'' (5) 

The Decree n ° 2020-1262 of 16 October 2020 was being updated during 2021. 
The state of health emergency had been extended several times and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (12)

*Comments*:
 Gabon declared a state of emergency on 10 April 2020, according to the Constitution (1) (art. 25 on the state of emergency or seige), and the law n°11/90 of 16 November 1990 on the state of emergency (2), with the decree n°00100/PR/PM of 10 April 2020 (3, 4).
On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and was institutionally replaced by a state of health emergency, brought about with a new law (based on Constitution, article 47) allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days, which was renewed for additional days. Under the new law, the state of (health) emergency continued, although under a different legal instrument (5). 

The state of emergency has been in place continuously since March 2020, after consecutive renewals. After 11 May 2020, the legal instrument used has been article 47 of the Constitution, and all renewals of the state of emergency were based on -and amending - law n ° 003/2020 of 11 May 2020 (6, 7).

 Q2 2020: Decree No 1 by the President declaring a state of emergency on 21 March 2020.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: measures have been implemented through amendments to the Resolution № 322 of the Government of Georgia of 23 May 2020 on the Approval of the Rules of Isolation and Quarantine "on the basis of Article 45 (3)
(1) of the Law of Georgia on Public Health, Article 5(c) and Article 6(2)(c) of the Law of Georgia on Personal Data Protection, the Law of Georgia on Healthcare, the Law of Georgia on Social Assistance, the Law of Georgia on Public Procurement, Article 30 of the Law of Georgia on State Budget of Georgia of 2020 and Article 6 of the Law of Georgia on Structure, Powers and Rules of Operation of the Government of Georgia. " Since Georgia has used multiple legal instruments, the Law of Georgia on Public Health is considered the primary legal instrument because it gives the government the power to implement measures related to isolation and quarantine.

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 in 2020 and Q1 in 2021, the emergency measures taken toward Covid-19 were primarily done by the German states, and the federal government acts as a coordinating unit. The German constitution includes a state of emergency-clause, but this has not been activated (different types of states of emergency has however been enacted at the state level). The main emergency measures have been taken under the Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which is a federal law, but the adoption of the measures is taken by the states under this Law, not the federal government. It is worth noting that the federal government has taken several measures, not least in subsequently amending the Infection Protection Act and also passing financial aid packages. The Infection Protection Act saw larger amendments in March 2020 and May 2020  to adjust to the situation of Covid-19, and yet another amendment in November 2020. The November amendment has caused debate in Germany as some (predominantly right wing) groups deem it too far reaching. Note also that a host of amenmdents and Covid-19 related legislation has been enacted in Germany during this time, creating a highly complex juridical context. However, in terms of how the legal instrument works it keeps the setup of the states implementing the measures that the amendment enables. The primary emergency response thus exists at the state level, and this is therefore coded as 6 for Q2-Q4 in 2020 and Q1 in 2021. 
On 2021-04-21, however, German parliament enacted a new amendment of the Infection Protection Act that mandates the states to impose a coherent set of restrictions if the number of Covid-19 cases exceed 100 in a 7-day period. These restrictions include curfews, restrictions on gatherings and restrictions on business. Thus, while state’s still have the possibility to extend further measures under such circumstances, there is a nationally determined baseline of restrictions that is applied when cases reaches a certain point. Given that the restrictions included in this new amendment are many of the most central ones, as of this point Germant is coded as having a national emergency response, and coded as 4 since this is no state of emergency but a new amendment to existing legislation.

*Comments*:
 On 15 March 2020, President Akufo-Addo initially declared restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19 and directed parliament to enact emergency legislation under Article 21 of the Constitution [1]. Six days later, the Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) went into force. Since 23 March 2020, President Akufo-Addo has announced several Executive Instruments under the Imposition of Restrictions Act [2,3,4]. The IRA provides the president the power to issue Executive Instruments that impose restrictions "in the event of imminence of an emergency, disaster, or similar circumstance to ensure public safety, public health, and protection" [5]. Restrictions may last for no more than three months at a time, with the indefinite possibility of extension by the President's sole authority. When contrasted with the Constitution's language on states of emergency, which require Parliamentary input, and the vagueness of the law, legal scholars question its constitutionality [6].

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1), and particularly article 44(1), has been the legal instrument the Greek government has been using to legislate on Covid-19 related issues throughout all quarters of 2020 and 2021. 
Art.44(1) gives extra powers to the executive in emergency situations (other than war). This legal instrument gives the executive the power for ''fast-track'' law-making, through the adoption of ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts are submitted to the Parliament for approval after their issuance, and are then accompanied by ''(Common) Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts Legislative Content. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 was passed by the greek government - and then approved by the Parliament - in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 6). The first nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March 2020 (7). The second lockdown was introduced in 7 November 2020, with an initial end date on 30 November 2020 (8). 
Consecutive Acts of Legislative Content and (Common) Ministerial Decisions have been issued during the pandemic (2, 3, 4, 5). See a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 9.

 On 27 March 2020 President Alpha Condé announced a nationwide state of emergency due to the spread of Covid-19 in the country, based on Constitution (2010), article 90, and Organic Law No. L/1991/016 du 1991 on the state of emergency and state of siege. (1, 2)

The state of emergency is still in place by June 2021 (last extended through 26 June 2021) after consecutive extensions and based on the same legal instrument. 

However, between 16 and 26 February 2021, there was no state of emergency in the country. The last extension had taken place on 14 January 2021, for a period of one month (till 15 February 2021). (5 , 6) 

The Guinean Constitution and law provides that the decree proclaiming the state of emergency ceases to be in force 12 days after its introduction, unless it gets authorization by the National Assembly for its extension. On 15 February 2021, the period of one month from the latest extension of state of emergency ended. Guinea had Constitutional referendum that led to the Constitution of 14 April 2020 being adopted (7). 

''Unlike the 12-days deadline provided for decreeing a state of emergency by the President of the Republic, the constitution of 14 April 2020 does not set a deadline for the National Assembly as to the extension. However, the state of emergency ceases to be in force at the expiration of the period provided for in the ordinance adopted. And for there to be an extension, an authorization from the National Assembly is required, an ordinance issued for this purpose by the President of the Republic and an announcement of the extension in the official journal.
Yet, by 16 February 2020, no authorization from the National Assembly had been granted for the extension of the state of emergency, and no extension announcement has been made in the official journal.
This situation renders de facto null and void the orders issued in application of the state of (health) emergency in the Republic of Guinea. Thus, if it is still necessary to establish the state of emergency, it will no longer be an extension but rather a new decree for a new start of the state of emergency for a period of 12 days at most.'' (5, 6) 

The state of emergency was reintroduced on 26 February 2021 for a period of 3 months, based on the same legal instrument, therefore it is coded as a continuation.

 Haiti declared a state of health emergency on 19 March 2020 for a period of one month through an executive decree (1, 2). Although the Constitution has a clause on states of emergency, there was no legal reference to it in the Decree or in the measures taken (8). 

The President is ruling by decree since January 2020, because the elections that were supposed to take place in October 2019 were not held, and the mandate of the Haitian legislature expired on 13 January 2020.  Ever since no legislature exists (7). The President continues to rule by decree as of June 2021. Haiti on 8 June 2021 postponed a constitutional referendum scheduled for June 27 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but did not give a new date for the vote (14).

After the lifting of the state of emergency in July 2020, other measures remained in place. The strictest of these was a 00:01-04:00 night time curfew (latest update available: 19 October 2020). Face masks are mandatory (9). Haitian authorities maintained the minimal restrictions -such as the wearing of protective facemasks and other social distancing measures - since the end of Haiti's state of health emergency in July 2020 up until May 2021. The longstanding nationwide 00:01-04:00 nightly curfew was also maintained (10). 

Due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, President Jovenel Moïse declared on 22 May 2021 in a decree published in the Official Journal Le Moniteur #27, the state of health emergency throughout the national territory, in effect from 24 May 2021 and for a period of 8 days. Under these restrictions, the nightly curfew will be in effect between 22:00-05:00 (11, 12, 13). 

The decree on the state of health emergency refers to the Decree of 15 March 2021 revising the Law of 15 April 2010 amending that of 9 September 2008 on the state of emergency (11). The said decree revising the law on the state of emergency could not be found however.

 The Executive Decree PCM-005-2020 declared a state of health emergency based on the procurement law [1]. The Executive Decree PCM-022-2020 suspended constitutional guarantees based on a constitutional clause [2], and it has been extended several times [3, 4]. Thus, I consider that the suspension of constitutional guarantees is the measure that most closely resembles a state of exception.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong has a type of state of emergency legislation called Emergency Regulations Ordinance (for example used to quell protests in the Fall of 2019), but this has not been used in relation to Covid-19. Instead, the government imposed a number of measures between January and March in 2020 that were based on existing statutes, and on March 27 2020 issued new regulation under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. On March 27 2020, Hong Kong authorities announced a new regulation called 599G Regulation that controls freedom of assembly, where they can ban any public gatherings over four people (the restriction on gatherings has since changed over time, for instance being at two people at times) under a specified period of no more than 14 days. Within this legislation, authorities are also given extended powers such as entering places without warrants. The overarching and principal legal instrument used to enact these measures has been the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, which was in place before the pandemic. It has been used throughout the whole pandemic to issue measures and restrictions. This is therefore coded 4 for all periods.

 Q2 2020: Government Decree 40/2020 declaring a special state of emergency called "state of danger" based on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53).

Q3 2020: Governmental Decree no. 283/2020 on introducing a state of epidemiological preparedness based on Act CLIV of 1997 on healthcare, section 247 (1b). Section 247 (1b) was amended by Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules and epidemiological preparedness related to the cessation of the state of danger ("2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről".  Section 247 (1b) authorizes the government to declare a state of epidemiological preparedness ("járványügyi készültséget ").

Q4 2020, Q1 2021:  Government Decree 478/2020 declaring a special state of emergency called "state of danger" (same legal instrument as in Q2 2020) based on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53) and on Act No. CXXVIII of 2011 concerning disaster management and amending certain related acts (Article 51, introduced by Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules and epidemiological preparedness related to the cessation of the state of danger ("2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről" )). Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53) is considered the primary legal instrument because it most closely resembles a "state of exception." The second state of danger on 8 February 2021 (termination declared on 29 January 2021).

Q2 2021: Third "state of danger" (same legal instrument as in Q2 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021) based on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53) and on Act No. CXXVIII of 2011 concerning disaster management and amending certain related acts (Article 51, introduced by Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules and epidemiological preparedness related to the cessation of the state of danger ("2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről" ).

 From 24 March 2020 to 31 May 2020, the central government invoked the National Disaster Management Act to declare Covid-19 a disaster (Section 10). This authorizes the National Disaster Management Authority to issue binding directions and guidelines to the several state governments, for the purposes of addressing a disaster. It centralizes the sphere of operations, giving the federal government overriding powers of enforcement. After this period, there have been multiple state-level emergency responses. 
Information related to the issues that are included and not included in the NDMA has been removed from the official website.

*Comments*:
 Iran has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 79), but this has not been activated. They have implemented several emergency measures, such as curfews, school closings, closing religious and public places and so on, but this has not been in reference to any such legal instrument. Likewise, the reentrance of several measures during October and November in 2020 had no references to legal instruments as far as have been found. Iran’s Supreme National Security Council set up a National Headquarter to Combat Corona in early 2020, which was given the authority to decide and impose measure against Covid-19, and it is this group (along with confirmation over decisions from the supreme leader) that has determined the measures for Iran. Neither such a group nor the measures it’s taken has been found to have any reference to legal instruments (the decisions by this group has no defined legal status, and are not subject to legal review as they are not technically laws, for instance). This is therefore coded as 5, Iran has a national level emergency response but without any specific legal instrument for those emergency measures.

 Iraq has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 61), but this has not been activated. Iraq has however had a national-level emergency response, including curfews, school closings and closing of public places, to which no reference to any legal instrument has been found. Rather, the measures seem to have been taken through government decrees lacking references to legal instruments. This continues to be the case in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, where Iraq has several emergency measures in place but without any reference to legal instruments as far as have been found. Therefore, this is coded as 5, a national-level emergency response without reference to a specific legal instrument.

*Comments*:
 Ireland has an emergency legislation, but it only allows for declaring states of emergency "in time of war or armed rebellion". The Irish government and parliament thus made a substantial amendment to the existing Health Act (the amendment is called Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) which gives the Minister of Health power to restrict gatherings, implement lockdowns, travel restrictions and the like. The main national level emergency response has thus been taken under this legal instrument, which is a new amendment, and therefore coded as 4. The legislation was most recently debated on October 22 2020, where the Irish parliament decided to extend the legislation from November 9 2020 to June 9 2021, and it thus continues to operate as main legal instrument for measures toward Covid-19. On June 4 2021, it was again extended until 2021-11-09. Note that some of measures taken under this overarching legal instrument are amendments itself, e.g. the current restrictions primarily stem from the “HEALTH ACT 1947 (SECTION 31A - TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS) (COVID-19) (NO. 2) REGULATIONS 2021”. This, however, is not regarded as the primary legal instrument itself, which continues to be the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020.

*Comments*:
 The Israeli Prime Minister declared a state of emergency on March 19 2020, based on Article 38 and 39 in the constitution (technically, Israel has been in a state of emergency since 1948, but the declaration that this also constituted an emergency situation enabled the government to use emergency regulations, which is the instrument applied under a state of emergency in Israel – so this effectively constitutes a state of emergency declaration even though such a state of emergency was already in place). This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within existing legal framework. On July 21 2020, Israel passed a new and temporary law called the Coronavirus Law (formally,  Law Granting Government Special Authorities to Combat Novel Coronavirus (Temporary Provision) 2020) that gives government extended powers during a state of emergency as well as allowing them to declare it for 60 days instead of 7 days. The initial state of emergency and extensions of it were taken under the articles mentioned above, but the current are taken under this new Coronavirus Law. While this temporary law is new (and has a sunset clause on 2021-06-30), they have still declared a state of emergency under it, and this is therefore coded as 1 rather than 4. The state of emergency has been extended multiple times under the Coronavirus Law, and is currently set to end on June 29 2021.

 A State of Emergency was declared by the Italian Government on 31 January 2020, with reference to the Legislative Decree No. 1 of 2 January 2018. This is thus not a constitutional state of emergency, but one taken with under regular legislation. Note that a number of decrees also have been issued after this to perform a number of emergency measures, but the initial emergency response is this declaration of a state of emergency. In late July 2020, the State of Emergency was extended to October 15 2020. On October 7 2020, it was decided to extend it yet again, to January 31 2021. In January, it was extended until April 30 2021. In April, it was extended to 31 of July 2021, which is the current end date. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 President Alassane Ouattara announced on 23 March 2020 the establishment of a state of emergency to combat Covid-19 throughout the territory until 15 April 2020 (2, 3, 4) with the Decree n°2020‐351 du 23 mars 2020 (5, 6), according to Constitution articles 73, 101, 105 (1), and Law 59-231 of November 7, 1959 on the state of emergency. It was accompanied by strict measures like a night time curfew, closing of services, and a ban on “unauthorised” travel between the capital Abidjan and the interior. 

The state of emergency was being renewed during Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2020 (11).  

On 21 January 2021, on the proposal of the Covid-19 Watch Committee, the National Security Council, under the chairmanship of the Head of State, Alassane Ouattara, ''decided to establish a state of (health) emergency throughout the territory, from 21 January to 28 February 2021.'' (see 8, 9). The state of health emergency remains in effect until 30 June 2021 (10). 

However, it is a bit unclear whether and when the state of emergency was lifted. The Communique by the Council of Ministers on 09-30-2020 (7) mentions that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020''. It appears that the initial SOE from 2020 expired sometime in December 2020, but was reintroduced on 21 January 2021.

It is also unclear if there is a different legal regime under which the 2021 state of health emergency was adopted, since the Government Press Releases do not make a reference to any legal instrument. The law is vague in the Constitution and the law from 1959 on the state of emergency could not be located. It appears that the state of health emergency and state of emergency fall under the same instrument so we code this as a state of emergency throughout.

*Comments*:
 The Jordanian King declared a state of emergency on March 19 2020 by a Royal Decree. The legal basis for this state of emergency is the Article 124 in the Jordanian Constitution. The declaration did not include an end date, however, but Jordan has continued to impose various restrictions such as lockdowns and curfews throughout the coded period (the latest being easing the curfew somewhat in may 2021). Garda also state in their country report from 2020 that the Covid-19 state of emergency is ongoing, and no indication has been found that it has ended and that current restrictions are based on any other legal instrument  This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within the existing legal framework, for all periods.

 Q2 2020: Decree 285 issued by the President on 15 March 2020 declaring a state of emergency from 16 March 2020 until 15 April 2020. The state of emergency ended on 11 May 2020.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: emergency measures were implemented using "the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system" that was amended several times.

For example, resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated July 3, 2020 No. 44 "On the introduction of strict restrictive quarantine measures" that is based the Order of the Minister of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated February 25, 2015 No. 130 "On approval of the List of infectious diseases, with the threat of the emergence and spread of which restrictive measures are introduced, including quarantine" (amended on 5 June 2020), which in turn is based on the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system (18 September 2009 version). Since the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system resembles the closest state of exception (based on paragraph 6 of Article 144, paragraph 4 of Article 150), it is considered the primary legal instrument.

In October 2020, one of the measures was Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated October 23, 2020 No. 59 based on the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system that was amended several times (on 27.10.20, 06.11.20, 04.12.20, 04.02.21, 30.04.21).

*Comments*:
 The Kenyan Public Health Act (1) is the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various actions during public health crises, including declaring an infectious disease a “notifiable infectious disease” or a “formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease,” and taking the necessary prevention and suppression measures to fight the disease.  Specific powers accorded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country.'' (2)

Kenyan authorities (MUTAHI KAGWE, the Cabinet Secretary for Health) declared on the Government Gazzette on 2 March 2020 (3):
(a) the Covid-19 disease as a notifiable disease for the purposes of section 17 (1) of the Public Health Act, and 
(b) that the provisions of Part IV of the Public Health Act shall apply with respect to the  prevention, control and suppression of the coronavirus 2019 disease.
This allowed the government to take the necessary measures in order to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic the same way as other formidable or notifiable diseases that are already included in the Act.

The Public Health Act (Sections 35 and 36) was first activated in order to the  to deal with the pandemic on 3 April 2020, with LEGAL NOTICE No . 49 (''The Public Health (Prevention, control and suppression of Covid-19) Rules, 2020 - Arrangement of Regulations'' (4), which has been updated ever since a few times (for the full list of legislation, see 8).

Before that, the ''Public Order Act'' (2003) (9) was activated -now the Public Order (State Curfew) Order 2020- effected by Legal Notice No. 36 of the Kenya Gazette Notice of 26 March 2020, imposing the countrywide curfew in Kenya, which was the strictest measure compared to the ones issued previously. (10).

Before 26 March 2020 a few other more general measures and guidelines had been issued (see 5, 6, 7). 

Authorities continue legislating on Covid-19 matters based on the PHA and POA as of June 2021 (see 11, 12)

*Comments*:
 Kuwait has issued a number of measures (e.g. curfews, closing of schools and workplaces, restricting religious gatherings), with many of these starting on March 12 2020. But there is no mention of any state of emergency having been declared, or any legal instrument being referred to when implementing these measures. Garda, ACAPS and the U.S. Embassy for example makes no mention of any such state of emergency, nor any other emergency legislation. The emergency measures has continued in 2021, still without any legal instrument referenced. Therefore, this is coded as 5 as there is a national level emergency response, but no legal instrument or declared state of emergency.

*Comments*:
 On 22 March, the Kyrgyz Security Council  declared emergency situation regime in the whole country (Decision 93 from 22 March 2020) which is in place at the time of coding (confirmed by a local media report quoting the Minister of Health in March 2021). On 24 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the cities of Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad and the Nookat and Kara-Suu districts of the Osh region and the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad region from 25 March that ended on 10 May. The capital Bishkek was under a state of emergency from 9 to 16 October following unrest after presidential elections (not part of the emergency response).

Note that although other sources refer to the emergency regime in the whole country as "state of emergency" (ICNL, International IDEA), here it is coded as emergency situation regime ( Art. 2 (4) ("chrezvychaynaya situatsiya") of the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018)) and not as state of emergency (Constitutional law on states of emergency)

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister issued a decree that specifies and regulates the main emergency measures in Laos, for example public gatherings, public transport, border closure etc. This is not taken in reference to any state of emergency or existing regulations, and is thus regarded as adopting a new law. No other instrument has been found that manages the emergency response, and the latest restrictions seem to also be based on the same legal instrument. This continues to be the legal instrument referenced when ordering newer restrictions (the latest extension of measures was made in May 2021), and as these announcements are decrees that reference this first decree it is here viewed as the main legal instrument for Laos Covid-19 response. Therefore, this is coded as 4 for all the periods.

 Lebanon declared a state of medical emergency on March 16 2020, which is an emergency declaration that differs from a general state of emergency (such a general state of emergency was also declared during this period, but in relation to the explosion in Beirut). The state of medical emergency was based on the 1957 law on Infectious Diseases and Legislative Decree No. 102/1983 on National Defence, and was announced as the decree “Declaring the State of General Mobilisation to counter the spread of the Coronavirus“. This has been extended several times, and is still in effect (current end date is 2021-09-30).

*Comments*:
 On 18 March 2020, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane declared a state of emergency under article 23.1 of the constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (4). The official notice of the state of emergency was not gazetted until 27 March 2020, in which it was stated to be made retroactive until 18 March (2). Pursuant under article 23.2 of the constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (3). As such, the state of emergency would have been set to expire on 31 March 2020. According to some interpretations - the 14 day period begins with the gazette notice and thus would have ended 08 April 2020 (5). Meanwhile, on 25 March, Prime Minister Thabane issued  a nation-wide curfew in effect from 29 March to 29 April 2020 (6).

On 15 April 2020, Prime Minister Thabane issued another declaration of a state of emergency until 28 April 2020 (7). Meanwhile, the emergency restrictions from the first declaration had remained in effect, despite being expired. 

On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (8,9). On 22 April 2020, Prime Minister Thabane announced an extension of the nationwide lockdown under the state of emergency and Public Health Act of 1970. These measures would remain in place until 05 May 2020 (10). 

On 28 April 2020, the National Assembly of Lesotho refused to approve a six-month extension of the state of emergency, citing concerns that it could be used for political gain and encouraging the government to instead use the state of national disaster (12).

On 06 May 2020, Prime Minister Thabane issued a decree lifting the nationwide lockdown, but keeping in place several other restrictions through 19 May 2020. This decree includes reference to "the disaster induced state of emergency declared ... under section 3 and 15 of the Disaster Management Act, 1997" (11, 17). No other document formally declaring such a state of disaster was located - but based on this we are left to assume that such a state of disaster was declared after Parliament refused to extend the state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (15). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate that it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (13). On 29 October 2020, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months (until 29 April 2021). This also aligns with the initial decree being for 6 months (14). 

On 28 April 2021, the Disaster-Incuced State of Emergency (State of Disaster) was extended for six months, to continue to be in effect between 30 April 2021 and 30 October 2021 (16).

 Initially, the government declared a national health emergency under the Public Health Law Title 33 (Chapter 14) Liberian Code of Laws Revised. On April 9 2020, a state of emergency was declared in accordance with Articles 85, 86, 87 and 88 of the Liberian constitution. This state of emergency expired on July 21 2020 and a revised national health emergency was announced on July 22 2020. This National Health Emergency is still in force, and became the main legal instrument after the state of emergency ended. Thus, this is coded as 2 from the first period without the state of emergency and onward.

*Comments*:
 The national-level emergency measures have been implemented by the Ministry of Health, pursuant under the Public Health Act and the declaration of Covid-19 as a "formidable disease" by the Ministry of Health on 01 April (6). 

On 20 March 2020, the President declared a state of disaster in Malawi, under the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act (3,4). Pursuant under this law, a state of disaster shall be in force for three months from the date specified in the declaration, but may end sooner or be extended by formal announcement in the gazette (4,5). No such early termination or extension could be located in the gazette notices, so we assume this state of disaster ended around 20 June 2020. 

Nevertheless, as Government Notice No. 5 of 2020 states, "These rules are enforceable whether or not a state of disaster in relation to Covid-19 is in force under the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act" (2). No mention of the state of disaster is made in the subsequent regulations issued after June. Therefore, we code for the entire period the main legal instrument as the Public Health Act, rather than the Disaster Preparedness Act. Further, because the Public Health Act does not provide for a state of public health emergency - and none such emergency has been declared under another legal instrument - we code this as being a case of other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 

On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020). These regulations came with reference to "section 31 of the Public Health Act" and the "declaration of the Corona Virus Disease as a formidable disease on the 1st day of April 2020" (2). This document also states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. 

On 14 April, the President and the Minister of Health announced a 21-day lockdown under the rules established by Government Notice No. 5. However, the courts issued an injunction against the lockdown on 17 April. Other measures under the Government Notice No. 5 appear to have remained in place without a clear end date.

On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. These regulations came with reference to "section 31 as read with section 29 of the Public Health Act and pursuant to the declaration of Covid-19 as a formidable disease on the 1st day of April 2020" (1).

On 20 September, the courts had their final say on lockdowns, ruling them to fall outside of the Public Health Act jurisdiction and that such measures limited oversight and accountability (7). Other regulations remain in place. 

In 2021, the Public Health Act continues to operate as the main legal instrument for Malawi’s Covid-19 response. Lockdown measures were announced in January, including the closure of schools. In February, schools were reopened, but the government kept many practices such as social distancing and the mandatory use of masks

*Comments*:
 Malaysia has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 150), but this has not been used in 2020. Instead, the government has issued emergency measures and regulations under The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988, which puts the Minister of Health in charge and allows him/her to issue regulations. The most significant such regulation instituted under this law is the Movement Control Order, which was put in effect on March 20 and regulates freedom of movement, association, closing of public places, bussiness and borders, and the like. As these are new regulations enacted by the government through an existing legal instrument, this is coded as 4 [3]. 
The Movement Control Order was extended on August 28 and is set to end at December 31 [6]. This new legislation eases some of the restrictions, and is called a recovery movement control order, but still keeps a lot of the restrictions in place. In 2020, it was used to impose conditional movement control orders in several states on November 9 [5].

Malaysia's King Abdullah declared a state of emergency across the country on 12 January 2021 [4].

 President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita decreed a state of health emergency and a curfew (applied from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.) on 26 March 2020 (2 and 3). 
There are two legal provisions relating to the state of (health) emergency in Mali: the law 2017 055 of 6 November 2017 (3) on the state of emergency and state of siege, and the Constitution, articles 49 and 50 (1). However, the decree issued did not refer to any of these provisions (see 2, 3, 4). 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted. 

No information could be found on whether the state of health emergency continued in Mail after its initial declaration. The night-time curfew was lifted on 9 May 2020. Preventative measures were in place after that date, like social disctancing guidelines and the mandatory wearing of face masks (5, 6). 

On 18 August 2020, following a military coup, the President and Prime Minister resigned, and Mali has been without a president and without a government since 18 August 2020. The country is led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita. ''Mali parliamentary elections were held on 29 March 2020 (second round on 19 April 2020), after having been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on 2 May 2020. The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on 12 May 2020.'' (see 7-11). 
Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on 1 April 2020 that authorized the government to take Covid-19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from 1 April 2020 until May 2020 when the parliamentary elections would have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020. In fact, no evidence was found on the bill being adopted at all. 

Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, the Malian transition government declared a state of health emergency on 18 December 2020, to last initially for 10 days (until 28 December 2020). The state of emergency was declared on the national territory by Decree n ° 2020-0317 of 18 December 2020, and was based on law 2017 055 of 6 November 2017 on the state of emergency and state of siege (12). 

The government extended the state of health emergency on 23 December 2020 until 26 June 2021 (13, 14). ''In accordance with Law n ° 2017-055 of 6 November 2017 relating to the state of siege and the state of emergency, its extension beyond 10 days is authorized by law.''

*Comments*:
 In mid-March 2020, the government of Mauritania took various gradual measures without a reference to a specific legal instrument, that were announced through Press Releases (see list of all measures (3)). 
These measures included the suspension of all events and demonstrations, restriction of border crossings (15 March 2020), a night curfew (18 March 2020), prohibition of all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) from 29 March 2020, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods (28 March 2020).

On 1 April 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991) (1), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: (2)
''Article 60 - After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers and require the approval of the President of the Republic[,] who signs them. They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

The government, on 10 July 2020, lifted the strict restrictions and the curfew. Preventative measures were maintained nationwide, like the wearing of masks ithat was made mandatory. However, these measures originate from the Ministry of Interior and are not taken under the emergency framework of article 60 of Constitution. 

Mauritania, due to a surge of Covid-19 cases, reestablished a nighttime curfew on 13 December 2020 (6-9). The curfew and the other measures however were not based on article 60 of the Constitution, but rather originated from the Ministry of Interior (see Government Press Release 6, 7). 

The curfew and other measures (like ban on gatherings, mandatory masks etc) are still in place by June 2021 (10). The curfew hours have been amended several times (see 11-14).

 The sanitary emergency was declared via the "Acuerdo por el que se declara como emergencia sanitaria por causa de fuerza mayor, a la epidemia de enfermedad generada por el virus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19)" [1, 2]. The "Acuerdo por el que se establece una estrategia para la reapertura de las actividades sociales, educativas y económicas, así como un sistema de semáforo por regiones para evaluar semanalmente el riesgo epidemiológico relacionado con la reapertura de actividades en cada entidad federativa, así como se establecen acciones extraordinarias" created a traffic light system, to be implemented on June 1, once the state of health emergency was lifted [3]. It establishes by means of colors the appropriate sanitary security measures to be implemented in each region [4, 5].

 Q2 2020: Decision No. 55 by the parliament to declare a state of emergency, which lasted from 17 March until 15 May. The declaration of the state of emergency was based on Constitution (Article 66 m) and Law 212 (2004) (Article 12) on states of emergency ("LEGE Nr. 212 din 24-06-2004 privind regimul stării de urgenţă, de asediu şi de război"). The Constitution is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles a "state of exception."

Q3 2020: National public health emergency ("starea de urgenţă în sănătate publică") was declared from 16 May and lasted until 30 September. It was declared based on Art 58. of "LEGE Nr. 10 din 03-02-2009 privind supravegherea de stat a sănătăţii publice"

Q4 2020: from 1 October, public health emergency ("stare de urgenţă în sănătate publică") in designated “high-risk” districts (US embassy) and emergency measures on a national level (National public health emergency was abolished) . It was declared based on Art 55 of "LEGE Nr. 10 din 03-02-2009 privind supravegherea de stat a sănătăţii publice". Since the legal instrument changed from 2 ("Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework
that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency") to 4 ("Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe."), emlaw for July-September and October-December is coded separately.

Q1 2021: National public health emergency declared from 19 March 2021 until 18 April 2021 based on "LEGE Nr. 10 din 03-02-2009 privind supravegherea de stat a sănătăţii publice" (Art. 58) (same legal instrument as in Q3). Since the legal instrument changes from 4 ("Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe") to 2  ("Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework
that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency"), emlaw is for October-December 2020 and January-March 2021 are coded separately.

Q2 2021: State of emergency was declared from 1 April 2021. Declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on 28 April 2021.

*Comments*:
 The Mongolian constitution has a state of emergency clause that has not been used. Instead, Mongolia initially took a string of emergency measures (border closure, school closure etc.) without any such state of emergency, and have later passed the Law on Covid-19 Prevention. This law authorizes the government to "take necessary measures, such as calling quarantine and traffic movement and time limits, as well as approving relevant regimes, procedures, and instructions to be followed during the COVID 19 pandemic.". The measures were initially meant to last till 12 December 2020. But it was later extended to 30 June 2021. Hence this variable is coded as 4 across all the time periods.

 A state of emergency was first declared on March 30, via the Presidential Decree nº 11/2020, and it was extended three times, until July 29. According to the constitution, a state of emergency can be declared for up to thirty days a time and it can be extended a maximum of three times. Since legally it could no longer be extended, President Filipe Nyus opted to declare a new state of emergency for thirty days starting from August 8, via the Presidential Decree nº 23/2020. The parliament approved the decree, but the opposition criticized the decision, which they considered unconstitutional since the state of emergency had already been extended the three times allowed by the constitution. After the first thirty days ended, the second state of emergency was not extended and, instead, a state of Public Calamity was implemented via Decree nº 79/2020.

 Namibia declared a state of emergency on 17 March 2020 through the Proclamation 7/2020 (GG 7148) ''The Declaration of State of Emergency: National Disaster (COVID19)'', pursuant to Article 26(1) of the Namibian Constitution and to section 30(3) of the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2012 (Act No. 10 of 2012) [1,2]. This Proclamation was approved by the National Assembly as required by Article 26 of the Namibian Constitution on 20 March 2020, which also extended the state of emergency for 6 months [3].

After the expiration of the state of emergency on 17 September 2020, the government did not extend it further [4]. Instead, the authorities used the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015 to deal with Covid-19 regulations. The Act was brought into force on 17 September 2020 by GN 230/2020 (GG 7338). Regulations affecting movement, public gatherings, mask wearing, curfews, and alcohol sales are still being updated based on this legal instrument [5], and are currently in place through 30 June 2021 [6,7].

Note that emend is coded as 17 September 2020 for Q3 2020, because the state of emergency ended, which is the emlaw for that period. Nevertheless, emergency measures continued throughout the entire quarter under the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015.

 The relevant legal document in this case has been the Infectious Disease Control Act 1964. The government made some amendments to this Act in November 2020. Section 2(1) of the Act "enables the Government of Nepal to take necessary action and issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons to root out or prevent the development or spread of an infectious disease."

The Act is broad. Section 2(1) can "provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary." [1]

*Comments*:
 The Netherlands has a State of Emergency Act in their constitution (Article 103), but this has not been used. For Q2 and Q3 of 2020, they have used a mixed set of policies and legal instruments to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. The main emergency measures have been taken under the Safety Regions Act (Wet Veiligheidregions), which allows 25 "safety regions" to enforce a number of emergency measures given that the there's a significant public health threat, which in turn is regulated in the Public Health Act. While the government coordinates a substantial amount of the emergency responses (the measures taken by the regions is more or less identical), the implementation and decision making lies at the regional level. Therefore, this is coded as 6 - no national-level emergency response - since the main legal instrument puts decision making and implementation at the regional level.
For Q4 of 2020, this changed however.  From 1 December 2020, regional emergency ordinances were replaced by a national "Emergency Act on measures against COVID-19" (Tijdelijke wet maatregelen Covid-19). This measures taken through this law have been debated as a court disallowed the use of a curfew under it (although an appeals court later partially revoked that decision), and parliament and the government then passed an amendment to this law enabling such a curfew. However, this Emergency Act continues to be the overarching legislation determining the Covid-19 response, and is at the time of coding set to end on 2021-09-01. This is therefore coded as 4 for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 Niger declared (4) a nationwide state of emergency to be applied from 27 March 2020 through an executive decree (2, 3). The state of emergency was instituted according to article 68 of Constitution (1) and law n ° 98-024 of 11 August 1998, modified and updated by law 2015-07 of 2015: on the application of the provisions on emergency - extraordinary measures. This Law could not be located.  

It is often referred to as a State of Public Health Emergency, mainly due to the fact that Niger, and the rest of Sahel region, are under a state of emergency due to security reasons. 
However, the constitution does not differentiate between a state of emergency and a state of health emergency, but instead has provisions only for a state of emergency (therefore coded as 1).  

The state of emergency due to Covid-19 has been prolonged several times (see e.g. 5, 6) and it has been last extended through 5 August 2021 (7). 
During Q1 of 2021, the state of emergency was prolonged on 5 January 2021 (see 8), and then prolonged again for 3 months in April 2021 (see 9).

*Comments*:
 Nigeria has called upon emergency powers to deal with COVID-19 without, however, having declared a state of emergency. The extant Infectious Diseases Law - the Quarantine Act 1926 - gives the President sweeping powers towards preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases' and to make regulations for associated purposes. However, the Quarantine Act has been in process of being repealed and substituted via a new Bill of health.

 A state of emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and July 2020 and the anti-epidemic headquarters was established around the country. It's borders were shut in late January and quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. 

North Korea claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. While this is highly unlikely, there hasn't been a need for additional emergency responses. 

A three-week lockdown was imposed in the city of Kaesong in July 2020 after a suspected case of Covid-19. No information was released to say if it had been a confirmed case or a false alarm. There has been no additional information on the state of emergency in North Korea.

 March-June 2020: The government declared a state of emergency on 18 March, initially for 30 days (Decision 08-526/2). On 15 May, it was extended by 14 days (Decision 08-682/2). It was then extended by another 14 days on 30 May (Decision 08-729/2), and ended on 13 June. On 15 June, the state of emergency was declared for 8 days to prepare for parliamentary elections (Decision 08-777/3). According to Decision 08-777/3, the state of emergency is declared for holding parliamentary elections with public health measures due to covid-19; since it is declared with reference to covid-19, it is considered part of emergency measures.

July-September 2020: the primary legal instrument for this time period is "Zakon za zaštita na naselenieto od zarazni bolesti" (Law on Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases). This legal instrument gives the government authority to implement emergency measures.

October-December 2020, January-March, April-June 2021: State of crisis (kriznata sostojba) was declared by the government on 20 November 2020 based on the Crisis Management Law ("Zakon za upravuvanje so krizi"). The legal instrument gives the Crisis Management Center the authority to implement emergency measures. State of crisis was extended on 9 June 2021 until 31 December 2021.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, Norway passed a new law, the Corona Act, on 24 March 2020. This was the main legal instrument under which measures were enacted, and therefore coded 4 as this was a new law. In addition to measures passed under the Corona Act, Norway has other implemented emergency measures based on the "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases), first used to adopt quarantine measures for people arriving from abroad as "Vedtak etter lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer § 4-1 andre ledd om karantene (isolering) etter reiser utenfor Norden" (13 March 2020, FOR-2020-03-12-271), and some emergency measures were passed as amendments to "Forskrift om smitteverntiltak mv. ved koronautbruddet (Covid-19-forskriften)" from 27 March 2020 (FOR-2020-03-27-470). At the same time, the Corona Act expired on 2020-05-27, which made the "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases) the main legal instrument, and is still in use. All of these constituted new laws and were no state of emergencies, and this is therefore coded as 4.

 Pakistan never went into a state of emergency. The governments of the four provinces have instead declared health emergencies depending on the situation in the different areas. For example, the government of Punjab declared a health emergency on 12 March 2020.

A joint civilian-military body called the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) was established to respond to the Covid-19 situation in Pakistan. However this is not a legal instrument. Hence I have coded this variable as 5 across all the time periods.

*Comments*:
 There were several emergency measures taken by the government in response to the covid-19 pandemic. The Resolución de Gabinete N° 11 declared a state of national emergency on 13 March 2020. However, it is not based on the constitution, that foresees a "state of urgency" in which the government could suspend constitutional guarantees. Rather, it is based on the public procurement law, which facilitates the purchase of goods and services to deal with an emergency situation and provides the government with an emergency fund. Thus, I consider that the measure that most closely resembles a state of exception was the Executive Decree nº 507, from 24 March 2020, which declares a complete lockdown and defines other emergency measures. The measures continue throughout all the quarters coded.

This act is still in place, and has been used to enforce strict emergency measures during 2021 as well. After Q2 of 2020, this is therefore coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 The Decree nº 3456 from March 16 declares a state of public health emergency and the Decree nº 3478 from March 20 expands the first and establishes sanitary measures against the expansion of Covid-19 in the Paraguay. The government also declared state of emergency (Law 6524 from March 26) for budgetary and fiscal reasons, but the state of public health emergency establishes measures that most resemble a state of exception.

 A national state of calamity was declared across the Philippines on 16 March 2020. This was planned to stay  in effect for six months. On 23 March 2020, President Duterte enacted the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. This "authorizes the president to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to Covid-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress. The act would allow President Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost 275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated 438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to "temporarily take over or direct the operations" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities "when the public interest so requires" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and "facilitate and streamline" the accreditation of testing kits. 

2: A COVID-19 law that went into effect on March 24 grants the administration broad powers to address the coronavirus, which has contributed to violations of human rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, access to information, and children's rights.

3: The national state of calamity was extended by a year to September 2021 on 22 September 2020.

*Comments*:
 There have been several emergency measures in Qatar, such as closing cinemas, theatres, children’s play areas, gyms and wedding venues, including those in hotels; stopping all flights; stopping public transportation; distance teaching in schools. No reference to any legal instrument has been found when implementing these measures. The measures were eased in phases starting on June 15 2020, and were relatively relaxed during the fall and winter. In February 2021, harder restrictions were reimposed and many continue to be in effect although some easing of these were introduced in May 2021. Again, no reference to any legal instrument has been found, and this is therefore coded as 5 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The government of the Republic of the Congo, declared a "state of health emergency" on 28 March 2020 (to enter into force from 31 March 2020) through a presidential decree (2). The state of health emergency was based on Constitution (1), articles 93, 157 (provisions on state of emergency). 

Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency,despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the Constitution looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. ''state of siege'') as warranted.

The state of emergency has been renewed several consecutive times, using the same legal instrument.

 Q2 2020: State of emergency declared on 16 March with decree no. 195,  published in the Official Gazette no. 212, based on the  Constitution (Article 93, paragraph 1, Article 100), "ORDONANȚA DE URGENȚĂ nr. 1 din 21 ianuarie 1999" (unofficial translation:  Emergency Ordinance of Government no. 1/1999 (Article 3 and Article 10), approved with modifications and additions by Law no. 453/2004). The Constitution is considered the primary legal instrument because it most closely resembles a state of exception.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: State of alert declared on 18 May 2020 based on multiple legal instruments where  Law 55/2020 is considered the primary legal instrument since it most closely resembles a state of exception. Law 55/2020 was passed by the parliament on 15 May 2020 and has regulated the state of alert. The state of alert has been extended several times and is in place at least until 11 July 2021.

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: Russia used the Constitution (Article 80) to implement a "DECREE ON MEASURES TO ENSURE SANITARY-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF RUSSIAN POPULATION" that used in Q2 2020 on a federal level. The decree ordered the first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May 2020, and ended on 11 May 2020, as announced by President Putin. The decree also delegates the declaration and implementation of emergency measures to the heads of regional authorities for that time period.
 
Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: emergency measures were taken at the regional level. For example, a state of high alert was announced by all Russia's regions (see references to regional decisions on consultant.ru source), so it was de facto declared in the whole country, but not on a federal level (and therefore is not coded).

*Comments*:
 The Rwandan government took several measures to deal with the pandemic, but these were not based on a specific legal instrument. While the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda provides for a declaration of a state of emergency, in which the COVID-19 pandemic would fit as a disaster that needed the President to intervene, the authorities did not declare a state of emergency. (1) 

On 21 March 2020, the Prime Minister of Rwanda announced a nationwide lockdown - for an initial period of two weeks - accompanied by a prohibition of no-essential movements and travel between cities, closure of non-essential businesses, and a few more general social-disctancing instructions. (2, 3). 

On 30 April 2020, the government loosened the lockdown, and instituted an 8pm to 5am curfew (4, 5). 
The nationwide lockdown was extended several times, and most of these measures were still in place in November 2020 (see 6, 7, 8). 

In January 2021 the authorities implemented a nationwide night curfew and reinstated the lockdown in Kigali (9, 10). The lockdown in Kigali was eased in February 2021 (11). 

The nationwide night curfew is still in place by June 2021, after being consecutively extended (see 12-16).

*Comments*:
 The Saudi government have taken many emergency measures, such as curfews, lockdowns of some areas and regions, travel bans, border closure and closing of religious and public places. However, this has been without any declared state of emergency, and there's no reference to specific legal instruments under which these actions are taken in the source, nor that they have adopted any new laws. This lack of legal instrument has also remained in the other periods. This is therefore coded as 5.

*Comments*:
 The Senegalese President Macky Sall declared on 23 March 2020 a state of emergency (3, 4) in accordance with article 69 of the Constitution (1) and Law 69-29 of 29 April 1969 (2). 

After the state of emergency was lifted on 30 June 2020, the Senegalese government took various measures such as the mandatory wearing of face masks, based on the Constitution and the powers related to the minister of Interior (see 5, 6). 

On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of 29 April 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. (see 8, 9). 
The parliament enacted amendments to law no.69-29 of 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. As a result, in 2021, the same legal instrument is in place, as amended, but emlaw is now most accurately coded “2“. The ''state of health disaster'' was initially declared on 5 January 2021 accompanied by a night time curfew in two regions (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies) (7, 8, 9, 10). 

Senegal lifted the state of health disaster on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures (13).

 Q2 2020: A presidential decree 1186/2020, published in Official Gazette 29, declaring a state of emergency from 15 March 2020. 

On 7 July 2020, the President announced "as of tomorrow all public gatherings in Belgrade will be banned and that a curfew will be introduced from Friday until Monday" (1), which he later announced would not be possible without declaring another state of emergency. The announcement triggered large anti-lockdown protests, and the measures were not implemented. On 17 July, new restrictive measures were introduced (prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, making wearing masks and practicing physical distancing mandatory).

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2020, Q2 2020: after the state of emergency ended, emergency measures have been implemented based on  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti" (Law on Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases) and "Zakon o Vladi" (Law on Government).  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti"  is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles "a state of exception" (Art 6. gives the government authority to declare and implement emergency measures related to infectious diseases). The legal instrument was used to declare "UREDBU o merama za sprečavanje i suzbijanje zarazne bolesti COVID-19" ("REGULATION on measures for prevention and control of infectious diseases COVID-19") (among other decrees) that has been amended several times in these time periods, with the latest amendment on 13 May 2021 as of the time of coding.

 Singapore adopted the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 on 07 April 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This came after Prime Minister Lee announced initial measures on 3 April 2020. Prior to this, Singapore's response had drawn on its experience with SARS, implementing contact tracing, mask wearing, targeting at-risk populations, and imposing quarantines on travelers or travel bans from areas where outbreaks were widespread. From April 2020 to present, the government has issued a series of amendments to the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 and implemented emergency measures under this act using control orders. 

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 was originally in force until 19 October 2020 (1). It was then extended one month until 20 November 2020 (2). Then from 20 November 2020 to 31 March 2021 (3). Some parts were then extended until 30 June 2021 (4).

 Q2 2020: State of emergency ("Núdzový stav") declared on 16 March by the government (Order 114/2020) on the basis of Art. 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 227/2002. Constitutional Law No. 227/2002 distinguishes between two types of states of emergency:  "Núdzový stav" (Art.5, includes pandemics) and "Výnimočný stav" (Art 4, only in response to terrorism or widespread violence).  

Note that most sources (media, ICNL) refer to the measures as "state of emergency", with the exception of OSCE report that refers to the measures as "emergency situation."  Using "emergency situation" to refer to the state of emergency (declared from 16 March until 13 June 2020) can be problematic. 

Q3 2020: "Emergency situation" ("Mimoriadna situácia") (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights refers to it as "the state of crisis") was declared from 12 March 2020 based on "Zákon Národnej rady Slovenskej republiky o civilnej ochrane obyvateľstva" (paragraph 8) and has continued during and after the state of emergency ("Núdzový stav").

Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: State of emergency ("Núdzový stav") declared on 1 October  Art. 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 227/2002 (same legal instrument as in Q2 2020). It was extended several times and ended on 14 May 2021.

*Comments*:
 The main emergency measures were declared under the Communicable Diseases Act Declaration (Zakon o nalezljivih boleznih (ZNB)). Part of the measures was a declaration of "epidemic" from 12 March 2020 until 15 May 2020, from 18 October until 18 December 2020 until 16 June 2021 (as of the time of coding).  Since the declaration of "epidemic"  does not give the government additional powers, ZNB is considered the primary legal instrument. According to OSCE report (p.26), Slovenia (among other countries) "declared some form of special public-health related status, not amounting to a "state of emergency", based on existing or newly adopted primary legislation, and not the constitution" (1) (in this case, it is existing legislation). Since emergency measures based on the ZNB were passed in all time periods, it is coded as the primary legal instrument in all time periods.

According to Democracy Reporting (report from 27 July), "The 1991 Constitution envisages the option for the National Assembly (or, if the Assembly cannot meet, the President of the Republic) to declare a state of emergency when a great and general danger threatens the existence of the state (Article 92). Importantly, when the state of emergency has been declared, most of the constitutional rights can be temporarily suspended. However, at no point during the epidemic was a state of emergency declared. Severe limitations of the constitutional rights were thus enacted on the basis of existing legislation, namely the Communicable Diseases Act (ZNB). The powers vested in the executive branch by the ZNB are inadequate for an epidemic of this scale and a strict reading of the relevant clauses of the ZNB cannot support measures as drastic as the ones that Slovenia saw between mid-March and early May 2020."

*Comments*:
 In March 2020, Somalia responded to its first case of Covid-19 by establishing an emergency task force that included government officials and NGO partners. This task force has produced a preparedness response plan [1,2]. During the first wave of infections in 2020, the government closed schools for several months, implemented curfews, banned public gatherings, and put in place mask-wearing mandates [3,4,5]. According to Garda, many of these restrictions remained in place at the end of 2020 [8]. As a new wave of infections hit, the government again shut schools, furloughed civil servants, and banned public gatherings in February 2021 [6,7]. These restrictions came without reference to any specific legal instrument. It is also important to note that the extent to which federal regulations are implemented outside of Mogadishu by the country's federal member states is unclear [8,9] (see subvar).

 The Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act is the most relevant law in effect regarding the Covid-19 outbreak in South Korea. The IDCPA provides the government with very specific means to distribute resources and mobilize and stimulate various actors across the society to tackle the spread of covid-19. It was amended on 4 March 2020.

According to Article 76 of the South Korean Constitution, the President can call for a State of Emergency. However this has never been enacted across all the time periods.

*Comments*:
 On March 16, 2020, President Salva Kiir implemented a number of emergency measures without reference to a specific law (1). Four days later, the Health Ministry formed a High Level Task Force Committee and this has provided advice to President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar on the implementation of emergency measures, still with no reference to any specific law (2).

A report by the African Network of Constitutional Lawyers, from 7 June 2020, reads: “It is worth noting that the government did not declare a state of emergency even though coronavirus was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a global public health emergency. However, the legal regime on state of emergency in terms of articles 189(1) and 101(e) of the Transitional Constitution, 2011 (as amended) grants powers to the President to declare states of emergency only ‘upon occurrence of an imminent danger, whether it is war, invasion, blockade, natural disaster or epidemics…’ and to cause such to be ‘submitted to the national legislature within 15 days.’ Owing to the far-reaching impact of the measures on peacebuilding and constitutionalism, one can argue that the national legislature should have been called upon to debate and approve measures to fight Covid-19. The role of the national legislature cannot be downplayed even in emergency as trust building and allowing check and balance to operate even in times of pandemic is a critical democratic safety valve. The constitutional command that the national legislative be consulted whenever public emergency is triggered is to ensure that requisite oversight on measures impacting on fundamental rights and constitutionalism is performed. There are critical voices already warning that the rule by decrees is thwarting any efforts to building a democratic governance in South Sudan.” (3).  

Since June 2020, no indications of implementation of a legal instrument to manage the pademic has been found.

 Sri Lanka did not go into a state of emergency. Instead nationwide curfew was introduced from 20 March 2020 to May 2020. Government press releases mention measures such as quarantine in Q3 2020, Q4 2020. In Q1 2021, travel between regions was banned.

The declaration of the curfew in Q2 2020 (1) refers to the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance (2). Moreover, “some within the GoSL have claimed that the Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance (QPDO), No.3 of 1897 provided the legal basis for such restrictions” (3). Since the declaration of emergency measures does not refer to any legal instrument, emlaw is coded as 5 in all quarters.

 Sudan's  Sovereignty Council declared on March 16, 2020, a state of health emergency. Articles 40 and 41 of Sudan's constitution regulate the state of emergency and there is no distinction made in the constitution between types of states of emergency. No separate legislative basis for a state of health emergency was found.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, the government proposed an amendment to the Comunicable Disease Act (Temporary authorisations in the Communicable Diseases Act due to the virus causing Covid-19) that parliament passed, which allows the government to impose temporary restrictions on gatherings and temporary closing of schools, business, public places and transport. This is thus a new regulation that gives government capacity for some emergency measures related to Covid-19, and is therefore coded as 4. Although the limitation on public gatherings based on the Public Order Act also applied during this period, the amendment to the Communicable Disease Act is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles a "state of exception".
For Q3 and Q4 of 2020, the major measures taken to limit Covid-19 spreading, such as limiting gatherings, was based on the Public Order Act (Ordningslag [1993:1617]) (existing legislation). The government prohibited public gatherings of more than 500 people from March 12 2020 (Ordinance 2020: 114), which was amended on 29 March 2020 (prohibiting public gatherings of more than 50 people) and on 24 November 2020  (prohibiting public gatherings of more than 8 people).
For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, Sweden has used the Covid-19 Act as the main legal instrument, which came into effect 2021-01-10, that provides a more thorough legal base for taking measures to limit the spread, e.g. limiting assemblies, closing business etc. It is a temporary law, and currently set to expire on 2021-09-30. The Covid-19 Act does not replace the other acts, but rather complements them. However, since its enactment it is the main legal instrument used.

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1, 2 and 3) on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19)). The regulations enacted by Switzerland’s Federal Council were based on the emergency powers provision of Article 185(3) of the Federal Constitution (1) (which authorizes it to “issue ordinances and rulings in order to counter existing or imminent threats of serious disruption to public order or internal or external security” for a limited duration) and on Article 7 of the Epidemics Act of 28 September 2012 (2) (which allows the Federal Council to “order necessary measures for all or part of the country” if an “extraordinary situation requires it,” restricting the cantons to acting in areas outside the scope of the federal order). 
The first Ordinance was imposed on February 28 2020, the second on March 13 2020 (expired on 22 June 2020), and the third on June 22 (in force through December 31, 2021). The second regulation contained and allowed farther reaching emergency measures compared to the first, and under which the main response such as closing of schools and public places and curfews were taken. It is therefore the one used as a start date.
Ordinance 2 was repealed and replaced by COVID-19 Ordinance 3 of June 22 (initially set to end on 2020-12-31, but was extended and is currently set to end on 2021-12-31) which has fewer restrictions than Ordinance 2. It continues to restrict border crossings and entry by foreign nationals, maintains provisions intended to ensure supplies of essential medical goods, and provides for federal funding of SARS-CoV-2 tests.
In addition, the Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on 25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers “only to the extent that they are required to respond to the COVID-19 epidemi When this was passed, ordinance 3 now finds it’s legal basis in this Covid-19 Act, and it thus serves as the main legal instrument from when it was passed. Both the ordinances in Q2 of 2020 and the Covid-19 act are new legislation, and this is thus coded for for all periods. 
A referendum was held on 2021-06-13 if the Covid-19 Act would continue to be in use or suspended, but the Act found support and will be in force as planned at least until the end of 2021 which is the current end date.

*Comments*:
 Taiwan never went into a state of emergency.

The Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens was passed in Taiwan's legislative Yuan on 25 Feb 2020. It authorizes government expenditure on relief compensation and economic stimulus in fighting the current Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to providing economic relief, the Special Act prescribes penalties for price gouging, carriers or suspected carriers endangering others, misinformation and violation of isolation or quarantine orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

At the same time, most of the government's actions have been authorized under the previously adopted legislation in particular the Communicable Disease Control Act 
and the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, rather than the Special Act. Hence, this has been coded as 2.

The Special Act was initially meant to be in effect till 30 June 2021. However it was extended to 30 June 2022 on 4 June 2021.

 Presidential decree 1544 on socio-economic measures for mitigating the consequences of covid-19 from 5 June 2020 that introduced emergency measures based on the Constitution. Earlier the authorities announced the ban on exit and entry of foreign nationals (12 April 2020) and restrictions on mass events (25 April 2020). According to OECD, emergency measures in Tajikistan are: "Closure of borders and international airspace; Regulations on food markets and price controls; Ban on key food exports; Requirement to wear masks; Closure of schools; Restrictions on mass events." (1) From 15 June, restrictions were eased and "malls, bazaars, restaurants, and hotels are permitted to reopen amid the easing of selected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions. Mosques, transit facilities, and state borders will however remain closed until further notice." (2, Garda 15 June 2020). According to the UN (12 November 2020), " No changes have been introduced to existing public health measures, which are limited to compulsory “mask regime” and social distancing in public places, as well as a ban for mass gatherings."(3)  I found no indication that the measures were lifted.

*Comments*:
 Tanzania had a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments from March to June 2020. In June 2020, former President John Magufuli declared the country "coronavirus-free". Since then, Tanzania has only had minimal Covid-19 restrictions, only concerning requirements on quarantining if people test positive for Covid-19 when entering the country. President Magufuli passed away in the middle of March 2021, and was succeeded by vice president Hassan. President Hassan has changed the tone on Covid-19, introducing an expert committee on Covid-19 and signaling that the Covid-19 denialism of Magufuli would be abandoned. However, since then only a few additional restrictions have been introduced concerning entry requirements for air travel and for cross-border traffic. These were introduced on May 4 2021, and no reference to any legal instrument has been found. No evidence of any other restrictions has been found, and the U.S Embassy [14] reports as of June 15 2021 no additional restrictions. In addition, even though President Hassan has not expressed or reiterated the significant disinformation on Covid-19 made by previous President Magufuli, Tanzania has yet to record a case of Covid-19 since April 2020. This is therefore coded 6 for Q1 of 2021, as more or less no restrictions were in place during that period. For Q2 of 2021, a few restrictions were imposed, but no reference to legal instruments has been found. This is therefore coded as 5 for Q2 of 2021.

A Public Health emergency was declared on July 24 (called the “The Public Health (Dangerous infectious Diseases) Protection Regulations, 2020”, and based on the Public Health Act Cap 40.02 and the Quarantine Act, Cap 42.03), and was the main legal instrument when the state of public emergency ended. Gambia lifted most of its restrictions in December 2020, though keeping some such as the use of face masks and keeping distance in public, as well as travel bans. This continues to be the case, where Gambia has had few restrictions during 2021, and relied on a few regulations and general recommendations of keeping distance (along with relatively closed borders). No other legal instrument has been found for these measures, and this state of health emergency is for instance referenced in documents in 2021 that issues entry bans. This is therefore coded 2 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

*Comments*:
 The president of Togo declared a three-month nationwide "health emergency,"on 1 April 2020, and a six-month period of exceptional lawmaking authority under Article 86 (and 94) of the Constitution. (1)
Before the president's declaration, on 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of 1 April 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.

Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the Constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 5, 6), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly ssee link 6), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution.
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the Constitution looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

 No state of emergency is declared, since Tunisia already has an active state of emergency since 2015 (provided for by Decree no.78-50 of 26 January 1978 [8]. However, Articles 70 and 80 of the Constitution have been activated as the main legal instruments to provide the Prime Minister and the President respectively with increased powers to carry out an emergency response to the pandemic.

*Comments*:
 Although the Turkish Constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued circulars and decrees based on ordinary laws - Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 (2) allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. As Turkey has continued to use this regular legislation to handle Covid-19, this is coded 4 for all periods. 
''The Law on the Protection of Public Health authorizes Public Health Councils in all provinces to take necessary measures for removing threats against public health and assisting the execution of measures taken against a pandemic. According to the same law, under specific pandemics, infected patients can be kept in quarantine, travellers may be medically examined, and public places effected by pandemic may be closed down and evacuated. The Law on Provincial Administration stipulates that a governor of a province is responsible and authorized for taking necessary measures to provide peace, security, and public well-being; these measures include prohibiting certain people from entering or exiting certain places.'' (1)
However, ''instead of presidential decrees, all measures in Turkey were taken with administrative decisions generally in the form of presidential or ministerial circulars (legally atypical regulatory acts are almost at the bottom of the hierarchy of norms, and they cannot be contrary to laws and regulations. Typically, circulars are issued only for clarifying provisions of laws and regulations.) None of the decisions except one declared directly by the Presidency were published in the Official Gazette and most legal professionals, let alone ordinary citizens, would have a difficult time finding the original texts of these circulars and decisions.''
The first significant legal measure undertaken was the closure of all schools and universities. While the authority for closing down schools due to a pandemic is subject to the Law on the State of Emergency, the Ministry of National Education declared that it was decided to have an early holiday for a week and transition to distance learning starting from March 23rd 2020. This decision was never published in the Official Gazette but immediately executed. The strictest measures affecting daily life in Turkey have been those taken by the Ministry of Interior. Citing the powers mentioned above conferred by the Law on the Protection of Public Health and the Law on Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Interior in its ministerial circular on March 21 2020 declared a curfew for individuals who are sixty-five years or older, and anyone with a chronic illness, a measure that was executed nationwide as provincial Public Health Councils adopted identical decisions for curfew. ''The measures introduced in this period require a solid normative base which may either be the state of emergency or new laws adopted by the Parliament for directly addressing the situation otherwise in the long term the possibility of arbitrariness may be as destructive as the pandemic itself.'' This ruling through various decrees and announcements has been in place throughout the pandemic, and the legal basis for these within the two legislative instruments has been questionable at several instances.

 Turkmenistan has not confirmed any Covid-19 cases. Among many reports that express concern about the situation (see links to Human Rights Watch articles), the U.S. embassy issued the following alert : “While there are no official reports of positive COVID-19 cases in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Embassy has received reports of local citizens with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 undergoing COVID-19 testing and being placed in quarantine in infectious diseases hospitals for up to fourteen days”, which was dismissed by the authorities as "fake news" (1) (Reuters 23 June 2020).  On 13 July 2020, the authorities issues orders to wear face masks because of high concentration of dust in the air (as reported in state media). According to Garda, "the government has also advised individuals to use personal protective equipment (PPE), to maintain a social distance of at least 1m (3ft) apart when in public, and to avoid standing near air conditioners after spending time outside." (2) According to OECD, the emergency measures in Turkmenistan are "Closure of borders, Restrictions on internal movements of people and goods" and "Despite the government claiming that there are no cases of COVID-19 in the country, a range of containment measures designed to restrict the movement of people and goods were implemented in early summer and remain in place as of October 2020." (3) According to OSCE report (p. 26), the emergency measures are "screening and quarantine measures, temporary closure of passenger traffic, physical distancing, closure of cafes, restaurants and entertainment centers". (4)

*Comments*:
 The "Public Health Act of Uganda (Cap 281, 2000)", is the main instrument used to make the rules in "The Public Health (Control of COVID - 19) Rules, 2020" and various amendments to them throughout 2020 and 2021 [5]. A state of emergency has not been declared along the lines of Article 110 of Uganda's Constitution. While this Article does not include disease as a reason to declare a state of emergency, this official declaration of a state of emergency would regulate the executive's powers, define the timeline of the state of emergency, and provide parliamentary oversight. [1] There is other legislation that would have supported the declaration of a state of emergency, but it has not been invoked. "The 2011 National Disaster Preparedness Policy, lists pandemics as a disaster that merits government intervention. Section 2.1.8 of the policy anticipates pandemics like COVID-19." [4] There were calls in spring 2020 for the President to declare a State of Emergency by judges and legislators [6][8] but the executive declined to do so. [7]  "The decision not to declare a state of emergency has deprived the Parliament of its constitutional mandate to monitor or balance the Executive powers’ self-assigned ‘exceptional powers’ over the extent of restrictions to rights and freedoms over the past couple of months." [2] There was a nationwide lockdown for almost 3 months in Q2 2020. [9] On June 7, 2021, President Museveni introduced another partial lockdown for 42 days that includes restrictions on inter-district travel, school closures, and suspension of markets and churches. [10] Effective 18 June 2021, the country is under another nationwide lockdown for 42 days, with all private vehicles banned from roadways and schools, bars, restaurants closed; restrictions are also in place on funerals.

*Comments*:
 The UK government has enacted two new sets of regulations, the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020, and the Coronavirus Act. Both enable several emergency measures related to Covid-19. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) is here counted as the main legislation, as it provides the main limitations on freedom of movement, gathering and the closing of public places and business. This regulation is based on the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, which thus serves as the overarching legal instrument for these measures. Noteworthy is also that there are four separate such regulations for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the regulations are very similar and provides the same emergency measures capacity across the UK. This is a new law, and not a state of emergency declaration, and is therefore coded as 4.
Note that The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on July 3 2020 and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/684), which relaxed some emergency measures. It is still the initial one that counts as the primary legal instrument here, which has ended, but there is thus still emergency legislation in place in the UK. Under the no. 2 Regulations 2020 of 4 July 2020, more measures were added increasingly to stem the spread of covid 19 between July and September 2020. Between October 14 - November 4 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations was introduced, which categorized each local authority area under one of three levels of restrictions. This was revoked on November 5 and replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200), which enforced the nationwide second lockdown regulations (in effect until 1 December 2020). On 2 December the UK government replaced SI 1200 of November 5 with 2020 SI 2020/1374 which reintroduced a countrywide three-tier legal framework. These Regulations were set to expire at the end of 2nd February 2021, but was subsequently extended to 31 of march 2021. It was replaced on March 29 with the current regulation titled Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021, which is currently set to expire on 2021-06-30. 
All the aforementioned Regulations were introduced under the same legal instrument, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The slight difference in regulation also continues between England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who all have their own version of this regulation, all however being based in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.

*Comments*:
 President Trump made a declaration under the National Emergency Act, declaring a nationwide emergency in relation to Covid-19 on 2020-03-13. This emergency situation is still in force, as it was declared to continue for another year by President Biden on 2021-02-22. Consequently, this is regarded a declaration of state of emergency, within the existing legal framework. Note also that President Trump declared an emergency situation under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act on the same day (2020-03-13), which also provides emergency powers for the government. These powers however primarily pertain to financial and administrative assistance to states, and is thus not regarded as the main legal instrument here.

*Comments*:
 On 29 January, the President issued order 5537 on creation of an anti-crisis commission. The government passed several decrees with emergency measures but mostly the measures have been announced by the anti-crisis commission (e.g. on its website and Telegram channel "Koronavirus Info | Uyda Qoling!") or the President. Legislation included decree 176 from 23 March 2020 (stopping some business activities, prohibiting all public events, closing access to the capital for everyone excluding its permanent residents). Previously, the government passed decree 5969 from 19 March 2020 on economic measures. The measures have been in place in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared via the Decree nº 4160 from March 13, 2020 [1, 2]. The lastest extension identified was until March 30, 2021 [3]. However, there are still strict quarantine measures in place, which restrict constitutional rights [4, 5]. This suggests that the state of emergency is still in place.

*Comments*:
 Vietnam never declared a state of emergency. They instead activated their Emergency Epidemic Prevention Centre. Other measures that were implemented include establishing 40 mobile emergency response teams. A lockdown was also imposed.

Vietnam did not declare a state of a emergency in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. However, other Covid19 related restrictions continue to be in place to varying levels across the country.

*Comments*:
 On 13 March 2020, the Minister of Health, Chitalu Chilufya, declared Covid-19 a "notifiable infectious disease" (1) and issued Statutory Instrument No. 22 of 2020, The Public Health (Infected Areas) (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Regulations, 2020 (2). These regulations are put forth under sections 28, 30, and 114 of the Public Health Act (3). Since then, more Statutory Instruments have been introduced under the Public Helath Act (4).

While the Ministry of Health initially led the response, in coordination with the WHO, the president appeared to have seized control by issuing a series of restrictions since March 2020 that have been amended at various points and continue through Q2 2021 (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
