## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has a state of emergency legislation in the constitution (Chapter XI), but this has not been used. Maynmar has however had a national level emergency response, for example closing borders, imposing curfews and restricting gatherings. Myanmar has continued to issue such measurements during the fall of 2020, such as stay at home orders in some townships and extending flight bans. The legal basis for these measures are varying and often unclear. Some measures have been taken with reference to Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law – whereas others have been taken without any reference (for instance, many of the early announcements of restrictions and limiting public gatherings held no reference to legal instruments – and the extension of these refer back to those initial announcements). The Myanmar Parliament also amended the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases in May, and it seems to be used for some aspects of dealing with the pandemic. At the same time, people who have been charged with violating restrictions have been charged under several different penal codes, with varying penalties in relation to the same crimes, again indicating that there is no one or main legal instrument used to deal with Covid-19. Therefore, for Q2-Q4 in 2020 this is coded as 5 – a national level emergency response without specific reference to a legal instrument. 
On February 1 2021, a military coup displaced the government. The new government also imposed a year-long state of emergency, but not in relation to Covid-19. Multiple sources contend that since the military coup, the restrictions have mostly been kept in place, although most of them have not been confirmed or enacted anew under the new government (for instance, the U.S. embassy states that much of the restrictions have not formally been announced again since the coup, and restrictions can change without formal notice). Thus, the exact restrictions in place are somewhat unclear in Myanmar, but in general the restrictions remain as they were before the coup (Garda for instance mentions that the restriction of no more than 30 people gathering remains as of early May 2021, and have also continuously reported that restrictions have remained in place since the coup). Since the measures and restrictions seem to be the same before and after the coup, and no reference to legal instruments has been found, this is coded as 5 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 5

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 During Q2-Q4 in 2020, the Myanmar parliament continued to conduct its work, and the emergency measures has not changed or limited their law making role as far as has been found. For example, parliament has debated a lot of Covid-19 related measures, as well as handling proposals for Covid-19 related law making and amendments (which they must pass for them to come into effect), during May and June 2020. No evidence has been found that the parliaments lawmaking role has been affected in Q3 and Q4 either. Noteworthy is that Myanmar held parliamentary elections on November 8 2020, but the existing parliament would not be replaced until February 1 2021 so this had no impact on the parliament or law making during Q4.
The new parliament was supposed to convene for the first time on February 1 2021, but the Burmese military staged a military coup, declared a year-long state of emergency and have not let the new parliament convene. They have also incarcerated large parts of the previous parliamentary members, some of which have died in custody. Since the coup, there is no parliament sitting in Myanmar, but this dissolvment is not in relation to Covid-19. It is thus coded as 5, parliament dissolved for some other reason than Covid-19.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Many of the emergency measures have been enforced nationwide. However, there have been variation in that curfews initially were only placed in three regions (Yangon, Ayeyawaddy, and Nay Pyi Taw). On september 26 2020, the government also implemented special stay at home orders in several townships. This is therefore coded as 2, there has been some sub-national variation, for Q2-Q4 2020. Since the coup, the military has maintained most of the existing restrictions, including the regional variation. Garda for instance reports that there has been continuing variation between regions, as some had more restrictions than others before the coup. This is thus coded 2 for Q1-Q2 of 2021 as well.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 There are reports of some discrimination from law enforcement onto the Rohingyan population, who has been subject to harassment, as well as unlawful fines, when attempting to cross checkpoints that are part of the emergency measures. Similar reports are found in the second period, where Rohingyans and Rakhians have been subject to police targeting and extortion. However, no sources indicate that this is national or regional policy, or that there are any more severe or systematically imposed instances of de facto discrimination ongoing in relation to the Covid-19 emergency measures (the more severe discrimination of Rohingyans is from before the emergency measures and not part of the Covid-19 response, and thus not accounted for here). While no new reports of discrimination have been found in later periods, there has not been any evidence or indication that discrimination toward these groups have ceased or any indication that the situation has improved. This is therefore coded as 1, minor de facto discrimination, for all periods.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 0

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 0

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 While there are reports of violations of human rights in Myanmar, and especially so in the recent years, no evidence has been found of any violations of non-derogable rights in the Covid-19 emergency measures. After the coup on 2021-02-01 the violence and human rights abuse from the government has exacerbated, but as far as has been found this has not been in reference to any Covid-19 restrictions, but rather in relation to the state of emergency. Thus, while major human rights violations of non-derogable rights is ongoing in Myanmar, these are not related to the Covid-19 response. Thus, this is coded 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures do not place de jure limitations on media, but Myanmar has previous de jure limitations on media that has been used to restrict reporting on Covid-19. Article 505 of the Penal Code states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is illegal and can result in prison up to two years. This penal code has been in continued use since the coup, with several journalists being put on “wanted lists”. This, however, is not a part of the emergency response and was in place before the Covid-19 crisis, and no sources state that Myanmar has introduced any new de jure limitations since then, so this is coded as 0 for all three periods.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 A journalist was arrested and jailed for two years in May 2020 for reporting on a person having died of Covid-19, under Article 505 of the Penal Code stating that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public". This legislation evidently puts de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19. Myanmar has also closed down over 200 websites in response to the crisis, many of which were media outlets, claiming that these sites spread "fake news”, a ban that has largely continued throughout the year. Furthermore, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders in place during the fall of 2020, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both Covid-19 and non Covid-19-related news. After the Coup in 2021-02-01 the limitation of media freedom has only been exacerbated, and by now more or less no independent media exists in the country. Journalists are also put on wanted lists, and access to internet and media remains severely restricted by government. While many of these measures are not made with reference to the pandemic, they fully limit any reporting on the pandemic, the governments response and the like. Thus, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 0. No.

*Comments*:
 Myanmar had severe restrictions on media freedom before the coup in 2021, and after that more or less complete restrictions on media freedom. While none of these restrictions, as far as have been found, were made in relation or with reference to Covid-19, but rather with Article 505 of the Penal code which was in place before the pandemic. However, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders that have been invoked at different times and in different regions since the start of the pandemic, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both Covid-19 and non Covid-19-related news. Since the government after the coup have kept most restrictions in place, this is assumed to be ongoing. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 There is widespread reports that Myanmar is covering up the actual number of cases and deaths of Covid-19, and that media is not given access to any information on this beyond the government approved information. This lack of access is ongoing in both Q2 and Q3 of 2020 according to a report by Article19, and no evidence has been found indicating that the situation has improved. In addition, stay at home-orders in place during in various townships in Myanmar have not exempted journalists, which effectively limits their capacity to investigate and access information about Covid-19. No indication has been found that the situation has improved after the coup, and the media has more or less banned all independent media and any transparency, thus affecting access to information on Covid-19 as well as anything else. This is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports that Myanmar has misreported the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, but no sources have been found that state that the government has produced disinformation on Covid-19 itself. Myanmar has a webpage with numerous documents on Covid-19 and information for the public, but these are all in Burmese and Google Translate isn't able to translate this well enough for those documents to be examined. This is coded as 0, as no direct evidence of disinformation has been found, but note that the documents produced by the government has not been assessed.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 For Q2-Q4 in 2020, there are reports of some instances of physical harassment against Rohingyans by both police and military who guard checkpoints in place due to emergency measures. However, no sources found have stated any more severe cases of violence, or that this physical harassment is widespread. While there are no reports of this is Q3 and Q4 of 2020, no indication has been found that the situation has improved, or that the authorities have changed their strategies and behavior. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods. Note here that the substantial violence by the military in the Rakhine state is not part of the emergency measures, and no sources have mentioned that the state or military have excused or legitimized that violence with any reference to Covid-19.
Since the 2020-02-01 coup, extensive violence by primarily the police force has occurred, killing hundreds of protesters. Much of the violence has erupted as a result of police enforcing Covid-19 related nightly curfews the new government has upheld (but which were enacted by the previous one). When enforcing these curfews, extensive violence has been used toward protesters who have been active during nighttime. Since this is related to Covid-19 through these curfews, this is coded as 3 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1)

*Comments*:
 The military is involved in securing check points for traveling in Myanmar, and this is therefore coded as 1. No sources have been found stating that the military has additional tasks in the emergency measures, but the military presence is very large in Myanmar so it is possible that they have been involved in additional measures. No reports have been found on the military activity in these regards in Q3 and Q4 of 2020, but as no evidence confirming that their involvement has ceased has been found, this is assumed to be on going and coded 1 for these periods. The military presence has increased as a result of the coup, and there is no evidence suggesting that the military has relaxed it’s presence in enforcing Covid-19 restrictions such as curfews. This is therefore coded as 1 for these periods as well.
