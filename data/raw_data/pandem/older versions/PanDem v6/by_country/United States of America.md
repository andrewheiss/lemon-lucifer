## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 President Trump made a declaration under the National Emergency Act, declaring a nationwide emergency in relation to Covid-19 on 2020-03-13. This emergency situation is still in force, as it was declared to continue for another year by President Biden on 2021-02-22. Consequently, this is regarded a declaration of state of emergency, within the existing legal framework. Note also that President Trump declared an emergency situation under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act on the same day (2020-03-13), which also provides emergency powers for the government. These powers however primarily pertain to financial and administrative assistance to states, and is thus not regarded as the main legal instrument here.

 A national emergency under the National Emergency Act can only be declared for a year at a time, but can be extended. President Biden extended the national emergency on 2021-02-11, and it is thus set to end on 2022-03-01 currently. Note that national emergencies can be extended multiple times, and other national emergencies have been in place for several decades in the U.S.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

The President therefore needs no approval from Congress to declare a national emergency.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The National Emergency Act, or related emergency measures taken such as under the Stafford Act and Public Health Service Act, do not provide the executive any additional lawmaking power, nor does it limit the legislatures lawmaking role. The National Emergency Act grants the executive access to a number of emergency authority statutes that can be activated. Consequently, only already existing statues are made available, not the capacity to without the legislature create new ones. In addition, no evidence of any de facto changes in the law making role has been found. Congress has been active in related areas as well, for instance passing Covid-19 relief bills, and their work during in terms of other obligations and debating and legislating in other areas seem to be continuing as usual.  Important to note is also that many of the measures in place during the coded period have been enacted by state authorities, and to what extent the law making role has been limited in relation to governors and other authorities is not accounted for here, so any such potential limitation is not included in this question.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 3

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 3

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 The national emergency does not determine how states respond to Covid-19, it opens up a lot of federal leeway to aid states and territories in differing ways and allows federal agencies to contribute to for example health care and emergency actions. So it has been up to the states to themselves determine their response to the pandemic. The states differ in terms of what and how many emergency measures and Covid-19 related regulation they have enacted, as is shown both by the National Governors Associations compilation of policy and legislation in all states and territories, and in the National Conference of State Legislatures (an interest organization for legislatures) compiling of data on state legislation during the pandemic. While a lot of states have taken similar or the same actions on a number of areas, the overall difference - both in content and in the timing of initiating restrictions and beginning to lift them - lead the overall interpretation of the subnational variation to be coded as 3. Note that during the spring of 2021, most states have relaxed many of the restrictions and have relatively few measures left. However, the way they have reopened has differed, and restrictions in terms of mask wearing, whether bars and restaurants are open (and for what time, with what capacity etc.) and the like still differs, both between states and between counties within states. This is therefore coded 3 for this period as well, although there seems to be a movement toward less sub-national variation.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 While Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has continued to provide regular updates and information to the public, President Donald Trump, the White House Covid-19 task force, and the White House press secretary have been hostile toward the media, often refusing to answer their questions, limiting access to press briefings, and holding such briefings infrequently. In May 2020, for example, President Trump abruptly ended a press briefing, after refusing to answer questions about Covid-19 testing - calling it a "nasty question" (1). In April 2020, President Trump refused to answer any questions at a press briefing where he suggested people should use disinfectants and light to treat Covid-19 (2). The White House Covid-19 task force led by Vice President Mike Pence did not brief the press for four months. When they did in November, they refused to take any questions (3). Likewise, in the regular White House press briefings, the Press Secretary often refuses to call on reporters critical of the government - calling them "activists" (4). Reporters without borders report on a number of occurences, initially reported in varying media outlets in the U.S., where journalists have been denied access to information and public officials having been prohibited to talk to media from government officials (5).
However, no evidence of this limitation on access to information in relation to Covid-19 has been found under the Biden administration. This is therefore coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents verbally harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have verbally harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There are numerous instances in which President Trump and his colleagues have verbally harassed journalists and news agencies. Reporters without borders have published two articles on this, and the verbal harassment of individual journalists and news agencies are widely covered in the press in general, especially those stemming from President Trump. However, reports of this have only been found in the first period, and this is therefore only coded 1 for this period. Note also that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests and election protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19. The same has been reported in some instances in later periods, where members of the press have been threatened by law enforcement. However, these have not had any connection to Covid-19 restrictions either, and thus not accounted for here. As no evidence has been found of any threats in relation to Covid-19, this is coded 0 for all other periods.

Some later reports of physical harassment of members of the press from law enforcement has been found, but this is not in relation to Covid-19 and thus not accounted for here. There are also several occurrences of violence toward journalists by protesters, but these are not related to Covid-19 measures either. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The Atlantic (6) provides a list inaccurate statements about Covid-19 by  President Trump (with reference to where the original statement was made), and why they are wrong. For example, President Trump has stated that it would disappear come warmer weather, that it would simply disappear due to a miracle ("One day it's like a miracle - it will simply disappear"), that vaccines will be available much earlier than any other sources claim, that antimalaria medicine is an effective treatment for the virus, that injecting disinfectants could be used as a treatment against the virus, that many medical staff are using antimalaria medicine/injecting disinfectants as a way of protecting themselves against the virus, and that media outlets were overblowing fears about the virus to interfere with the election. Many of the claims have also been repeated, and when questioned, President Trump has defended many of them. However, government agencies and agents, most prominently the CDC, have also provided information fully in accordance with WHO, and have also contested many of President Trump’s claims. It can therefore not be regarded a systematic dissemination of information about the virus from the government and its agencies as a whole, but rather a mixed and conflicting message where President Trump often has provided information on the virus that is not in accordance with WHO. While the disinformation was most intense in the first period, statements have continued and/or not been revoked and this is therefore coded as 2 for all of 2020. However, no evidence has been found of such disinformation in the last days of the Trump administration, nor any from the Biden administration (or other authorities during this period). This is therefore coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 While there have been numerous incidents of police violence in the US since March 2020, for instance in relation to Black Lives Matter protests during the summer, no reports have been found that any of these are linked to enforcing Covid-19 restrictions, or that any other use of excessive force has occurred within the Covid-19 emergency measures. This is therefore coded as 0 for all periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 FEMA, who is in charge of managing and overseeing a lot of the national emergency, has not deployed the military or used the military to enforce any confinement measures. However, states have the opportunity to use the National Guard to enforse such measures, and some states have (See the rubric "is FEMA deploying the military?" in the source). The National Guard is not, however, the army organization responsible for external security. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, such as storms, fires, earthquakes or civil disturbances.
