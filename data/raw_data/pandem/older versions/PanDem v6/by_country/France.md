## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 On 23 March 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a health state of emergency, initially declared for a period of two months from 24 March 2020 to 24 May 2020, and extended until 10 July 2020, when it was lifted (Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 - The “Emergency Law”) (6). 

On 11 July 2020 a new law came into effect (LOI n° 2020-856 du 9 juillet 2020 (9)) that outlined the conditions for lifting  the state of health emergency and organizing the transition  period. This law contained several restrictions on civil liberties such as that the Prime Minister could still be allowed to regulate gatherings and movement, and to close establishments. This law was brought before the Constitutional Council, which ruled the Law was according to the Constitution, but noted that the powers of the PM to regulate or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles under certain conditions can only be pronounced for the period from 11 July 2020 to 30 October 2020 and only in areas with a high circulation of  the  virus, and cannot prohibit people from leaving their homes. (8).

On  14 October 2020, the health state of emergency was reinstated in France (10), based on the Public Health Code and through the Decree No.2020-1257 that indicates that the Covid-19 epidemic constitutes a health crisis in France (8). The Decree n ° 2020-1262 of 16 October 2020 was then issued, prescribing the general measures necessary to deal with the epidemic of Covid-19 within the framework of the state of health emergency (11). 

Although the French Constitution (1958) and primary law deals with emergency situations by virtue of three sets of provisions: (i) 'presidential exceptional powers' (Article 16 of the Constitution), ii) the 'state of siege' (Article 36 of the Constitution and Article L. 2121-1 of the Defence Code),  and iii) the 'state of emergency' (Law No 55-385 of 1955)), the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of 23 March 2020 is new legislation. 
This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code (8), allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''
The new Emergency Law is temporary, and it is due to expire entirely by 1 April 2021. It also needs the approval of the legislature if it is going to be implemented for more than 1 month.

''These provisions supplement a preexisting article of the Public Health Code, article 3131-1, which allows the minister of health to order “any measure proportionate to the risks and appropriate to the circumstances … to prevent and limit the consequences” of a serious health threat to the population. This provision was considered inadequate on its own to deal with a crisis such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, as it placed almost the entire burden of the response on the minister of health. The new provisions, by contrast, are meant to create a more solid and comprehensive framework that involves the entire government.'' (5) 

The Decree n ° 2020-1262 of 16 October 2020 was being updated during 2021. 
The state of health emergency had been extended several times and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (12)

 The French Assemblée National approved on 21 March 2020 a legal text that would introduce a “state of health emergency” in France during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The law would give the French prime minister “the power to declare, by decree and upon recommendation of the Health minister, general measures setting limits to the freedom of movement, the freedom to enterprise and the freedom to congregate and would allow him to proceed to the requisition of all necessary goods and services to fight against a health disaster.”

The law of 11 July 2020 was approved by the Constitutional Court and the National Assembly on 9 July 2020.
The second state of health emergency was voted by Assemblee Nationale on 5 November 2020. The state of health emergency had been extended several times during 2021 and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly, gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (6)

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The Emergency Law gives the executive the powers to rule by Decree in matters related to the pandemic, although the approval of the law by Parliament is required. 
The new law of 11 July 2020 (n° 2020-856 (9)) that outlined the conditions for lifting  the state of health emergency and organizing the transition  period, indicated -after a decision by the Constitutional Court - that the Prime Minister may, by decree issued on the report of the Minister responsible for health, in the interest of public health and for the sole purpose of controlling the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic, regulate or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles under certain conditions which can only be pronounced for the period from 11 July 2020 to 30 October 2020 and only in areas with a high circulation of the virus, and cannot prohibit people from leaving their homes.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 The 2021 HRW world report for France (6) mentions: 
''Announced changes in law enforcement and crowd control tactics fell short of addressing concerns of abusive and disproportionate use of force by the police, including during demonstrations. Discriminatory police identity checks targeting minority youth continued. Child protection authorities often failed to provide unaccompanied migrant children appropriate care and services. Migrants and asylum seekers faced inhuman and degrading living conditions, as well as police abuse and harassment. Instances of harassment and attacks remained high against minorities, including ethnic, religious, national, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) minorities.'' 
''Discriminatory police identity checks continued, including during the enforcement of Covid-19 lockdown measures. Human Rights Watch found that police target minority youth, including children as young as 12, for the stops, which often involve invasive, humiliating body pat-downs and searches of personal belongings.'' 

''In July 2020, the ECtHR ruled that France violated the rights of three asylum seekers in depriving them material and financial support to which they were entitled, forcing them to live in the streets in “inhuman and degrading living conditions.”...In Calais, NGOs providing assistance to migrants and asylum seekers reported continued harassment and abuse by police against migrants and aid workers. In September 2020, the interior minister prohibited food distribution by NGOs not authorized or contracted by the State through 14 December 2020. The French Ombudsperson said the measure constitutes “discrimination based on nationality.”

France continued to detain people in immigration detention centers during the pandemic despite calls in March 2020 from the French Ombudsperson and the General Controller for Prisons for their closure given the risks of contracting Covid-19 and the fact that deportations could not be carried out in a reasonable timeframe due to travel restrictions. In September 2020, the government announced it would use a detention center outside Paris for people who tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19 while they awaited deportation.'' (6) 

'The available information suggests that the enforcement of measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in France had a disproportionate impact on members of racialized groups and residents of working class
neighbourhoods.'' (1)

''in France....asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in camps were targeted with forced evictions .'' (4)

'''For example, in Nice, predominantly working class and minority ethnic neighbourhoods were subject to a longer night-time curfew than the rest of the city. The police enforcement of Covid-19-related restrictions on movement reinforced already existing discriminatory and unlawful policing trends in those neighbourhoods. In Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest department in mainland France and where most inhabitants are of North and West African origin, the number of fines for breaching confinement was three times higher than in the rest of the country. In the first day of lockdown, 10% of the fines issued were in Seine-Saint-Denis”. (1) 

''Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March 2020 to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities....In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to the physical integrity of law enforcement officials or others. '' (1) 

'Since the beginning of the lockdown, many accounts, some corroborated by videos posted on social networks, reveal police stops that appear abusive, violent, and discriminatory, sometimes accompanied by racist insults.  Available official data, as well as information published in the media, also indicate a considerable concentration of police stops to enforce lockdown measures in “quartiers populaires” – working-class neighborhoods with a high number of visible minority residents and, for example, a fine rate three times as high as the national average in Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest neighborhood of Metropolitan France. The data and accounts suggest discriminatory behavior against citizens depending on where they live and a disproportionate impact of fines on socially and economically disadvantaged households, the organizations said.''

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Comments*:
 No de jure media limitations. 
The bill called “Global Security Law” presented in the past fall, and in particular its article 24, represented a concerning development. The provision would have penalized any “malicious” dissemination of images of
members of the security forces. This would have prevented journalists and others from filming the police in their interventions and may hamper the exposure of police violence. Following strenuous opposition and protests, the government dropped this provision as a way to “save” the law. (2)

 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 There have been several reports on police violence in France with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures. 
“On 28 November 2020, police officers have been filmed beating up a Black men after catching him without a mask on the the street'' (8, 9).

''The Covid-19 pandemic further revealed the heavy policing and the recurrent unlawful use of force in urban areas in France....'' 
Moreover, in the cases documented by Amnesty International, law enforcement officials resorted to the unlawful use of force while enforcing the measures, which in some instances may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.'' (2)

Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March 2020 to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities...In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to thephysical integrity of law enforcement officials or others.'' (2) 
 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Mohamed Gabsi, 33 years old, who died on 8 April 2020 in France.)'' (1)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 Emmanuel Macron drafted the Frech army into the coronavirus efforts, in order to help organize and support where the situation worsens by tranferring patients etc.

''The army will not be called upon to ensure the strict confinement of people as has been the case in some other countries, officials said. However, it will be used to protect strategic sites such as pharmacy depots and stockpiles of medical equipment and ventilators after a recent spate of thefts. 
It will also broaden existing efforts to shuffle patients around the country and also in France’s overseas’ territories, where two warships were dispatched this week as the situation worsens there.''
