## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Q2 2020: Emergency situation regime declared by the Cabinet of Ministers from 25 March until 24 April 2020 (order 338) based on KODEKS TSYVILʹNOHO ZAKHYSTU UKRAYINY; emergency situation regime ("Rezhym nadzvychaynoyi sytuatsiyi" is different from the state of emergency ("nadzvychaynyy stan") (the differences between emergency situation and state of emergency are also explained in the announcement of the decision in Ukrainian). Note that non-government controlled areas are not considered in the coding. Emergency situation ended on 24 April 2020.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: the legal instrument in these time periods is ZAKON UKRAYINY Pro zakhyst naselennya vid infektsiynykh khvorob ("Law of Ukraine On Protection of Population against Infectious Diseases") that was used to declare quarantine from 12 March 2020 (Decision 211) and that has been amended several times (e.g. decision 392 extending quarantine until 31 July, decision 641 extending quarantine until 31 December 2020, decision 1236 extending quarantine until 28 February 2021).

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The parliament performed its legislative functions with MP's working remotely in March-June. Plenary meetings were held physically and the parliament passed laws with emergency measures. According to Democracy Reporting, "The legislative branch of the government continued to function, even though several MPs fell ill with covid-19. As usual, MPs voted on laws during plenary sessions held inside the parliamentary building at 5 Hrushevskoho St. As one of the most significant changes in parliamentary activities during the quarantine, meetings (e.g. hearings) began to be held online. However, there were exceptions to this practice for hearings on high priority issues, some of which were held by MPs outdoors near the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament." (1)

 I found no limitations on the lawmaking role of the legislature in other time periods; the parliament continued to pass laws with emergency measures.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 In May 2020, , the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk verbally ordered the Roma to be expelled from the city for violating Covid-19 measures. Ten Roma were expelled from the city by force. Criminal proceedings for discriminations were launched against the major, and he later apologized. In June 2020, an event organized by the LGBTI community was dispersed due to alleged violations of quarantine restrictions, despite being previously approved by the authorities as well as compliance with quarantine requirements.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Comments*:
 In Kryvyi Rih, independent journalists were prevented from attending municipal council meetings on 18 March 2020 (on measures to tackle covid-19) while the city’s own media was allowed to attend. In Kakhovka, only two local media outlets were allowed to attend a council meeting on 19 March 2020 (on measures to tackle covid-19) while other media outlets were not allowed to enter the building. In the village of Lyubimivka, no media were allowed to attending local council meetings. On 4 November 2020, journalists were not allowed to attend the Zaporozhye City Council session about redistribute budget funds to combat Covid-19. According to local media reports, the situation persisted in 2021. According to a survey conducted by the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine in March-April 2021, 20% of journalists surveyed (47 out of 244 participants) said that they encountered obstacles to attending events with the participation of government officials  under the pretext of quarantine restrictions. Based on this information and the report from RSF, meinf is coded as 2 in all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 The military was tasked with enforcing quarantine in Q2 2020.

According to Amnestry International Report, the military also closed a footbridge to a village: "On 18 April, the Ukrainian army closed a footbridge, the only access to the village of Staromaryivka situated in a government-controlled section of the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Two weeks previously the "Donetsk People’s Republic" had closed access to the nearest town in the territory held by armed groups. This meant that about 150 residents including disabled elderly people and children were cut off from shops, health services and emergency services. The reason given was to prevent transmission of COVID-19 although no cases had been identified in the village. Villagers were allowed to cross the bridge again from 22 April." (1)

 Since I have not found any evidence of further military's involvement in enforcing quarantine measures, therefore military involvement is coded as 0 in 2021.
