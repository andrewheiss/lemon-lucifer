## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Although the Turkish Constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued circulars and decrees based on ordinary laws - Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 (2) allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. As Turkey has continued to use this regular legislation to handle Covid-19, this is coded 4 for all periods. 
''The Law on the Protection of Public Health authorizes Public Health Councils in all provinces to take necessary measures for removing threats against public health and assisting the execution of measures taken against a pandemic. According to the same law, under specific pandemics, infected patients can be kept in quarantine, travellers may be medically examined, and public places effected by pandemic may be closed down and evacuated. The Law on Provincial Administration stipulates that a governor of a province is responsible and authorized for taking necessary measures to provide peace, security, and public well-being; these measures include prohibiting certain people from entering or exiting certain places.'' (1)
However, ''instead of presidential decrees, all measures in Turkey were taken with administrative decisions generally in the form of presidential or ministerial circulars (legally atypical regulatory acts are almost at the bottom of the hierarchy of norms, and they cannot be contrary to laws and regulations. Typically, circulars are issued only for clarifying provisions of laws and regulations.) None of the decisions except one declared directly by the Presidency were published in the Official Gazette and most legal professionals, let alone ordinary citizens, would have a difficult time finding the original texts of these circulars and decisions.''
The first significant legal measure undertaken was the closure of all schools and universities. While the authority for closing down schools due to a pandemic is subject to the Law on the State of Emergency, the Ministry of National Education declared that it was decided to have an early holiday for a week and transition to distance learning starting from March 23rd 2020. This decision was never published in the Official Gazette but immediately executed. The strictest measures affecting daily life in Turkey have been those taken by the Ministry of Interior. Citing the powers mentioned above conferred by the Law on the Protection of Public Health and the Law on Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Interior in its ministerial circular on March 21 2020 declared a curfew for individuals who are sixty-five years or older, and anyone with a chronic illness, a measure that was executed nationwide as provincial Public Health Councils adopted identical decisions for curfew. ''The measures introduced in this period require a solid normative base which may either be the state of emergency or new laws adopted by the Parliament for directly addressing the situation otherwise in the long term the possibility of arbitrariness may be as destructive as the pandemic itself.'' This ruling through various decrees and announcements has been in place throughout the pandemic, and the legal basis for these within the two legislative instruments has been questionable at several instances.

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1).

*Comments*:
 Turkey has implemented several different and gradual measures in its Covid-19 emergency response. These were issued mainly through ministerial circulars, and the end date of most of them could not be found, or was announced later by the Minister of Interior. For instance, Turkey has announced that they will ease their restrictions as of May 2021, but no time limit for the current restrictions are set. This has been the case throughout the coded period, and generally the time limits of various measures have not been set. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 Turkey has used the Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442) as legal instruments to implement emergency response. Law no. 5442 on Provincial Administration, Article 11, does not require parliamentary approval for the actions taken by the Governor: ''a) The governor shall be the superior of all general and special law enforcement forces and organizations. He shall take necessary measures to prevent crimes from being committed, protect public order and security. For this purpose, he shall employ the general and special law enforcement forces of the State; the superiors and officers of such organizations shall be obliged to immediately execute the orders issued by the governor. b) The governor shall secure the border and coasts of the country, and execute all affairs relating to border and coastal security according to the provisions in force. c) The governor shall have the duty, inter alias, to secure peace and security, personal immunity, safety of private property, public well-being and the authority of preventive law enforcement. The governor shall take necessary decisions and measures to this end. Provisions of Article 66 shall apply to those who do not comply with such decisions and measures.'' (3)
Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) also does not seem to need parliamentary approval: ''the General Hygiene Law (Umumi Hıfzıssıhha Kanunu) No. 1593 is accepted as the constitution of healthcare services. The Law allows for quarantine application within the scope of “combating contagious and epidemic diseases”. Isolation practices and the quarantine of a certain region are described in Article 72. Authority to decide on quarantine implementation and other measures within the scope of combating epidemic diseases is given to the Ministry of Health for the country in general by the Article 64 of the Law numbered 1593.''

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The Turkish Parliament adjourned it’s session for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. On June 4 of 2020, Turkish Parliament resumed its work. On June 26 2020, Parliament was again shut until 30 June 2020 due to Covid-19 cases having been found. On July 2 2020 Parliament reopened, and parliamentary work continued (e.g. the election of the Parliament took place between July 2 and July 12). The Turkish Parliament started its fourth legislative session on Oct. 1 2020 with virus measures amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. Thus, the government has ruled by decree on a wide set of issues and with no clear demarcation toward only relating to Covid-19 measures. This has been the situation throughout the pandemic, and Turkey has in several instances been criticized for also using overly broad interpretations of what the laws they rely on allow, as well as implementing and announcing measures in ways inconsistent with the regular and established process. Thus, this is coded as 3 for all time periods.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 The Turkish government durign Q2 of 2020 imposed curfews and lockdowns differently across the country, with stronger restrictions in highly populated areas. For example, on March 30, April 4, April 10, April 18 etc in 2020., different areas and cities were put under quarantine, lockdown, or were obliged to introduced mandatory face masks. In the later periods, however,  became uniform and nationwide, and all extensive measures such as curfews, lockdowns, closing of businesses and the like have been taken at the national level.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There seem to be no discriminating elements in the measures taken in reference to Covid-19, and no reports on any discrimination within the emergency measures are reported by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Therefore, this variable is coded as 0.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 No reports have been found that non-derogable rights have been violated in the measures taken in reference to Covid-19, and no reports on any such violations in the enacted measures are reported by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Therefore, this variable is coded as 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position. 

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 0

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 0

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There are no reports found that any of the emergency measures places any de jure limitations on media. While media freedom is heavily restricted in Turkey, and harassment is on-going during the pandemic, there are no reports that any de jure limitations have been imposed as a part of Covid-19 measures, or during the pandemic. Other, already existing legal instruments for prosecuting journalists, such as Turkey’s terrorist law, has been in continued used during the pandemic however.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1)

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charge and media outlets are being censored as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading in Turkey. While these reports are of events occurring in the earlier period, this constitutes a de facto limitation in the latter periods as well, since it sends a clear message what happens if media outlets and journalists report news on Covid-19 that the government does not wish them to report.
In addition, Turkey's government passed a new law censoring social media and digital networks in July, which came into effect in October 1 2020. The law considerably strengthens authorities' control over social networks and threatens the presence of Twitter and Facebook in the country if they do not obey requests to remove contentious content. The legislation means social networks with more than a million unique connections per day must have a representative in Turkey, and platforms will also have to obey Turkish court orders to remove content that's reported as offensive by either individuals or the government within 48 hours. Failure to do so could lead to fines of up to €4.3 million or restrictions on bandwidth, blocking access to the platform.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding. 

 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1)

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 While there are de facto limitations as a consequence of or in relation to the pandemic, and many reports on journalists being charged with criminal offences for investigative reporting, no case has been found where the Turkish government or its agents have justified such acts of charging journalists for reporting on non-Covid-19 related news with any reference to the pandemic during Q2 and Q3 of 2020. However, in Q4 of 2020, there are reports that journalists were banned by a court from reporting of a case of illegal construction on a historic site, claiming Covid-19 being the reason. The paper that initially reported on this ban was also subject to a 3-day ban on operating. Therefore, this is coded 1 for Q4 of 2020. After this, however, no such limitations referencing Covid-19 has been found, and this is coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Much of the arrests of journalists, and charges placed on them, have been based on journalists accessing information from hospitals or hospital staff on Covid-19 which the government do not want them publishing and spreading. The Turkish government has more or less closed all access to information on Covid-19 according to Reporters without Borders and Amnesty International, and only wish the media to report on the information on Covid-19 released by the government itself. Furthermore, there are numerous accusations that the Turkish government have delibirately underreported the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. While there isn't as much reporting on this after the summer of 2020, there are no indications that the access to information has improved, and the media climate is still very restrictive and limited. This is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents verbally harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have verbally harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Several reporters that have published or researched issues on Covid-19 have been subject to police investigation and interrogation. However, these reports are only from Q2 of 2020, and no later reports of such arrests related to Covid-19 has been found (although journalists in Turkey are subject to threats that are not related to Covid-19 throughout the period). This is therefore coded 1 for Q2 of 2020, and 0 for the other periods.

## Physical harassment of journalists (*mephar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the government or its agents physically harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have physically harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 Turkey has arrested and detained several journalists for their reporting on Covid-19. However, these reports are only from Q2 of 2020, and no later reports of such arrests related to Covid-19 has been found (although journalists in Turkey are subject to arrests that are not related to Covid-19 throughout the period). This is therefore coded 1 for Q2 of 2020, and 0 for the other periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 In general, the Turkish Government's official guidelines conform to the WHO, but it has recommend treatments with hydroxychloroquine. For example has the Health Minister attributed Turkey’s at the time comparatively low death rate in part to the use of hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine was removed from the official Covid-19 treatment plan on 2021-05-07, but was in place throughout the pandemic before that, and seems to have been used through the period as well. This is therefore coded as 2 for all time periods. Note also that Turkey has underreported cases to a large extent, which is not the result of limited test capacity or the like, but underreporting through using a definition of Covid-19 case that does not concur with the one used by WHO, which the government itself admitted to in October of 2020. However, this underreporting does not suffice to increase the coding to 3, and this is still coded as 2 therefore.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 In April of 2020, a refugee was shot to death by law enforcement when running away from a Covid-19 check point. As this was lethal violence related to Covid-19 measures, this is coded as 2 for Q2 of 2020. For this and other period, there are also some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government. Stopping these demonstrations have been made with reference to Covid-19, that the demonstrations contribute to spreading the disease and therefore needs to be stopped. Other types of demonstrations have been met with force from authorities, who stop them referrecning Covid-19. The force seem to in several instances have been excessive, although no reports of lethal violence has been found. There is also one report by Human Rights Watch that states that there are a few reported instances where police have used excessive force when for example scattering or fining people in areas for not following Covid-19 regulations. These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and it seems to be relatively infrequent. Note also that there has been other instances of police violence in Turkey during the period, but this has not been in relation or reference to Covid-19. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods after Q2 of 2020.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
