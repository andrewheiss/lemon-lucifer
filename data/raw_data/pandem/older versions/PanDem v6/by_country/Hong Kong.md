## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong has a type of state of emergency legislation called Emergency Regulations Ordinance (for example used to quell protests in the Fall of 2019), but this has not been used in relation to Covid-19. Instead, the government imposed a number of measures between January and March in 2020 that were based on existing statutes, and on March 27 2020 issued new regulation under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. On March 27 2020, Hong Kong authorities announced a new regulation called 599G Regulation that controls freedom of assembly, where they can ban any public gatherings over four people (the restriction on gatherings has since changed over time, for instance being at two people at times) under a specified period of no more than 14 days. Within this legislation, authorities are also given extended powers such as entering places without warrants. The overarching and principal legal instrument used to enact these measures has been the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, which was in place before the pandemic. It has been used throughout the whole pandemic to issue measures and restrictions. This is therefore coded 4 for all periods.

## Beginning of emergency response (*emstart*) 

*Question*: When did the government first adopt this legal instrument in response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This refers to the date that the legal instrument defined in emlaw was first used to enact a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  If the exact date is unknown, the first day of the month is given.  If unknown, leave blank.

*Comments*:
 The Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance is the main legal instrument and was in place before the pandemic, and thus has no start date as such. However, the date reported here is for the first major restriction relating to democratic rights and freedoms imposed, which was the 599G amendment that restricted gatherings and freedom of movement significantly. This was announced on March 27 2020 and came into effect March 29 2020.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong have taken several measures under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. The main one in terms of affecting people’s democratic rights and every day life, and also the one addressed in terms of the start date for the regulations, is the 599G amendment that controls freedom of assembly and movement.  Initially, the 599G regulation was set to exist for three months (ending on June 29 2020), but was then extended and the expiration date for the regulation was set to 2020-12-31. It has again been extended and has the current end date of 2021-09-30. Measures taken within it, such as keeping or easing limitations on public gatherings, are made with shorter time intervals however, often in place around one week at a time. Other measures, such as closing business, has also had time limits, and no major restrictions imposed has been found to not have time limits in place.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

Therefore, the legislature need not and has not approved (or disapproved) the legal instrument or restrictions taken under it.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency legislation put in place during the pandemic has not in itself regarded or affected the parliaments work, and no general state of emergency or emergency legislation has been declared that allows the government to rule by decree. However, the statutes on which the measures against Covid-19 rely, and which have been in place in Hong Kong since 2008, enables the government to invoke measures related to a health emergency by decree given that such a health emergency is present. Also worth noting is that the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) allows the executive to “make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest” and these should “have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment” [1]. But, as noted under emlaw, the ERO is not being used as emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore it should not be considered here, as the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance (PCDO) is legal instrument used for Covid-19 measures.
The PCDO has been used for emergency response to the pandemic, and the government has the right to limit the powers of the legislature, due to some vagueness in the law (e.g. part 3.1, 2b, 5.1a.) However, the law is much more specific than many others and the vagueness has not been used.

The parliament has also continued to work during the pandemic, and also has some oversight capacity in relation to the measures taken (although this remains somewhat limited within the legislation). Thus, this is coded as 2 – the executive branch rules by decree, but on Covid-19-related measures, as the parliament has not been limited in other areas (apart from the limits the parliament faces more generally, but this is not related to Covid-19 or measures taken to combat it).  It is worth noting that Hong Kong postponed their planned parliamentary elections in September 2020 by a year. This has however not affected the current parliaments work, and this parliament continues to sit until the next election. Furthermore, a set of pro-democracy legislators were expelled from the parliament, and others left in protest. Again, this is not in relation to Covid-19 measures, and is thus not taken into account here.

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have not reported any discrimination within the response to Covid-19, and no other indications of such discrimination has been found. Important to note is that on April 30 2021, Hong Kong introduced some discriminatory measures toward migrant workers. They have been targeted by authorities as being of “high risk” to spread the virus due to their habit of “mingling” with other migrant workers. As a result, the government has ordered the migrant worker group to be mandatorily tested, as well as requiring them to get vaccinated or – if not wanting to get vaccinated – leave the country. Neither testing nor such vaccination policies has been directed to any other group of the population, and NY Times reports that there is no basis in these measures in terms of the extent of viral spread among migrant workers compared to other social groups. The requirement of vaccinations was whitdrawn a couple days later due to protests from parts of the population and officials from other countries, but the testing requirement remained and continues even though the first round of such testing showed a very low level of infections. This, however, is not regarded as discrimination within this coding as it does not affect migrant groups democratic rights such as movement, assembly etc. differently than other people in Hong Kong. Thus, this is coded as 0 for all time periods, although discrimination outside of the scope here considered has been going on.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II).

 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally.

*Comments*:
 While Hong Kong authorities have acted with repression in terms of many measures taken toward the pro-democracy movement and protests, especially under the National Security Law imposed by the Chinese government on June 30 2020, no evidence has been found of any violations of non-derogable rights in their Covid-19 measures, and this is therefore coded 0. Note also that the National Security law is not connected to the Covid-19 response.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Comments*:
 While there is legislation in place that can potentially severely limit media freedom (especially the National Security Law that came into effect on June 30 2020), no evidence has been found of any de jure limitations to media under the Covid-19 response in Hong Kong and this is therefore coded as 0.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 There are several restrictions to media in Hong Kong, especially through the National Security Law imposed on June 30 2020. In Q2 of 2020, the media in Hong Kong faced multiple limitations in its reporting, for example illustrated by the arrest of media owner Jimmy Lai in April 2020. While these restrictions mainly pertained to the pro-democracy protests, it is here regarded as constituting such overall limitations that Covid-19 reporting should be affected as well. And after the implementation of the National Security Law, which criminalizes speech and press that could "interfere", "disrupt" or "undermine" the Hong Kong and Chinese government, this constitutes an even greater de facto limitation on media. The implementation of this has continued throughout the coded period, and the media freedom in Hong Kong remains very limited. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

Rather, such measures have been referenced to other legal instruments, not least the National Security Law when it came into effect on 2020-06-30. No evidence has thus been found that any police violence has occured in relation to the Covid-19 measures, and this is therefore coded as 0.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
