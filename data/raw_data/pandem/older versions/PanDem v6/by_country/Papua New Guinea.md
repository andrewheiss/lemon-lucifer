## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 4

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 4

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, Papua New Guinea declared a state of emergency under Chapter X: Emergency Provisions in the constitution. This is therefore coded as 1. Note however that when this ended on June 16 2020, PNG replaced it with the National Pandemic Act which allows for numerous emergency measures in relation to Covid-19. This act is still in place, and has been used to enforce strict emergency measures during 2021 as well. After Q2 of 2020, this is therefore coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was extended a couple of times, but was not extended beyond June 16 2020, and has thus ended. However, on June 16 2020, it was replaced with the National Pandemic Act, which transfers most emergency powers to this law. These are still in force, and PNG had extensive Covid-19 measures during the spring of 2021.

## Time limit (*emlimit*) 

*Question*: Does implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19 have an officially declared time limit?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No end date for some or all provisions. 
 1. Yes.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 1

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was initially declared to be in place for two weeks, and did end after some extensions, the last one being set to 2020-06-16. The new emergency legislation, the National Pandemic Act, however is in effect and has no declared end date. This came into force in the late part of Q2 of 2020, and thus accounted for there as well (although the SoE had a declared end date, as noted above). For the Pandemic Act, measures under it can be active as long as a pandemic is declared under it. Therefore, there is currently no time limit to the emergency measures, but there was time limits under the initial state of emergency.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 0

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 0

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The head of state is allowed to declare a state of national emergency/pandemic situation without needing parliamentary approval (laws made under this state of emergency - emergency laws - does need parliamentary approval however). For the Pandemic Act, this in itself was passed by parliament. However, the activation of that instrument which enables all measures requires no involvement of parliament, as the head of state declares a pandemic situation which triggers available measures (Para 4; National Pandemic act). Thus, this is coded 0 for all periods.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 During a state of emergency, the constitution in part allows for emergency laws (passed by parliament) and emergency regulation (decrees by the head of state). The parliament has approved three such emergency laws, and these constitute the legislation that outlines the overall emergency response. The capacity for the head of state to invoke temporary legislation, the emergency regulation, however does limit parliaments law making role to some extent. At the same time,  they are also restricted in time (expire after 28 days), can be revoked by parliament and may only be issued if the parliament cannot reasonably convene in time for passing such a regulation as an emergency law. This is therefore coded as 2.
For Q3-4 of 2020 and Q1-2 of 2021, which has the Pandemic Act as the main legal instrument, there is a similar situation – after a declaration of a pandemic situation, a national control group is formed that takes most decisions and has the right to issue orders and decrees related to combatting a disease. They are obligated to report to the parliament, which also has some capacity to oversee and question measures, but effectively this control group determines the Pandemic response, but within a limited set of measures related to limiting spread of diseases. This is therefore coded 2 for these periods as well.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Papua New Guinea have taken many nationwide emergency measures such as school closings, lockdowns, quarantine rules and the like. However, within this, there have also been some regional variation in that some regions have imposed additional measures or prolonged those already in place, such as curfews, travel restrictions and limits on public gatherings. This is therefore coded as 2. For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, however, restrictions have been more homogenous and PNG have issued extensive measures nationwide to combat larger outbreaks than previously. Within this, some smaller sub-national variation has still existed, and this is therefore coded as 1 for these periods.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures did initially not include any de jure limitation on the media. However, after the implementation of a new emergency law, the National Pandemic Act, on June 16 2020, some de jure limitations were imposed. The Law states under Section 47 that ”A person commits an offense if the person … knowingly gives false or misleading information, or … recklessly disseminates false or misleading information to the public in relation to a Public Health Emergency”. Being found guilty of any of the offenses under Section 47 (which includes other offenses as well) can result in penalties of fines up to 50 000 Kina, and imprisonment for up to five years. 
This is a direct limitation of media reporting on Covid-19, as it bans ”false and misleading information”, but since this is vaguely formulated, this could very well be used to prosecute reporting on Covid-19 more generally. This is coded 2, as it limits media reporting to a large extent, but does not control it completely.

*Question*: When do the de-jure limits on media freedom end?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Provide the exact date the emergency measures with de-jure limitations on media freedoms (*medialimits*) are set to expire. If the exact date is unknown, give the final day of the month.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The national police commissioner stated in Q2 of 2020 that spreading misinformation on Covid-19 (i.e., its nature, prevalence and the like) will be arrested and charged under Cyber Crime Act. Since what such disinformation constitutes is unclear, and it opens up for journalists being prosecuted for reporting on Covid-19 that is not in line with the governments statements. After the passing of the National Pandemic Act in June 2020, PNG also with vague wording criminalized false and misleading information on the public health emergency, which clearly constitutes a limitation to reporting on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1. The law is still in use and a pandemic is still declared under it, and this is therefore coded 1 or all periods.

If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: During this quarter,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Comments*:
 The Guardian reports that "The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian.", which infringes media’s access to information on Covid-19. Furthermore, the Pandemic Act includes a vaguely formulated ban on spreading disinformation, that potentially can be used to hinder authorities and civil servants from providing information to the media and public. While no other accusations have been found, there is no indication that things have improved, and the Pandemic Act does provide a ground for continuing to limit access to information. As there is no evidence that this is systematically occuring, however, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*)

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have verbally harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic.

 In Q2 of 2020, The Police Minister called for the resignation of two journalists reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, stating that they "can't be trusted" (the minister did not, however, start any investigation or call for arrests). This is deemed a verbal harassment of these journalists, and thus coded as 1. However, no evidence of any threats to journalists has been found in relation to Covid-19 (or anything else) since then, and this seems to be an isolated incident. This is therefore coded 0 for all other periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

This does not seem to be widespread however, and no serious injuries or lethal violence is reported. For the other periods, neither Human Rights Watch nor Amnesty International has reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures, and no other indications on such violence occurring has been found. This is coded as 1 for Q2 of 2020, and 0 for the rest.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
