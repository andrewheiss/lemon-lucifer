## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 In mid-March 2020, the government of Mauritania took various gradual measures without a reference to a specific legal instrument, that were announced through Press Releases (see list of all measures (3)). 
These measures included the suspension of all events and demonstrations, restriction of border crossings (15 March 2020), a night curfew (18 March 2020), prohibition of all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) from 29 March 2020, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods (28 March 2020).

On 1 April 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991) (1), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: (2)
''Article 60 - After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers and require the approval of the President of the Republic[,] who signs them. They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

The government, on 10 July 2020, lifted the strict restrictions and the curfew. Preventative measures were maintained nationwide, like the wearing of masks ithat was made mandatory. However, these measures originate from the Ministry of Interior and are not taken under the emergency framework of article 60 of Constitution. 

Mauritania, due to a surge of Covid-19 cases, reestablished a nighttime curfew on 13 December 2020 (6-9). The curfew and the other measures however were not based on article 60 of the Constitution, but rather originated from the Ministry of Interior (see Government Press Release 6, 7). 

The curfew and other measures (like ban on gatherings, mandatory masks etc) are still in place by June 2021 (10). The curfew hours have been amended several times (see 11-14).

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The government, based on article 60 of Constitution, can rule by Ordinances on Covid-19 related matters (2). 
''The National Assembly adopted on 7 April 2020 the enabling bill authorizing the government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances, all the measures necessary to fight against the pandemic of Covid-19 and all its effects. In defending the text in front of the deputies, the Minister of Justice Haimoud Ould Ramdhane indicated that the situation also requires, in order to save time, which is one of the most important weapons of the battle, to transcend the limits between the executive and legislative powers, and to ensure that the legislature temporarily cedes its prerogatives to the executive in this area, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.'' (4). 

Social distancing measures in place - the Parliament continues sessions.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 During Q2 of 2020, the night time curfew and some other restrictions were nationwide, but there were travel restrictions into and out of the capital Nouakchott and in Kiffa (Assaba region). Further, movements between different regions in the country were also prohibited, with the exception of movement between Nouakchott-Ouest, Nouakchott-Nord, and Nouakchott-Sud regions (1, 2, 3). 

After 10 July 2020, during Q3 of 2020, there were preventative measures in place like social distancing guidlines and mandatory wearing of masks (4).

During Q1 and Q2 of 2021,the measures were nationwide. A night curfew was in place (hours of the curfew changed frequently), as well as other restrictive and preventative measures. (see 5-9).

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 No discrimination based on these rights.
However, rights groups have expressed that the harsh measures imposed to fight the virus have only intensified the social exclusion and discrimination Haratins already face.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

 On 24 June 2020, the National Assembly approved a new law - the Law on Combatting Manipulation of Information - aimed at prohibiting allegedly false news posts on social media. The Law states as its objective to prevent manipulation of information, publication of false news, and the creation of fake digital identities “especially during periods of elections and during health crises”, like the Covid-19 pandemic. Penalties for violations range from three months to five years in prison, and fines from 50,000 to 200,000 Ouguiya (US$1,325-5,300) (2, 3; see also 4 - 6). 
Many opposition parliamentarians as well as human rights activists denounced the law, declaring that it risks undermining the freedoms guaranteed by the constitution (3).

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 King Mohammed VI of Morocco ordered in June 2020 the shipment of medical aid to help 15 African countries - including Mauritania - in their efforts to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.'' (1) 
The shipment included 75,000 packs of chloroquine and 15,000 packs of Azithromycin.

Hydroxychloroquine has been part of Mauritania's treatment protocol adopted against Covid-19. No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3)

*Comments*:
 Security forces in Mauritania have engaged in violence to enforce the emergency measures during Q2 of 2020. No more instances were found during Q3 2020, and the emergency measures were lifted on 10 July 2020.

 'Security forces have at times resorted to violence against those breaking the curfew, with one video circulating on social media showing police beating, in the middle of a Nouakchott street, those who had turned out to protest against an activist's arrest.'' (1)

Another incident was found, but it hasn't been possible to verify if the information is credible, nor to find additional sources that report the incident, therefore it is not included in the coding score.
''Abass Hamadi Diallo was in southern Mauritania on 28 May 2020 near the border with Senegal that at the time was observing curfew regulations imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The young man, father of six, was helping a dark man and his nephew with the transport of merchandise when a gunshot hit him fatally in the chest.'' (2)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 'The National Police is responsible for enforcing the law and maintaining order in urban areas. The gendarmerie, a specialized paramilitary organization under the authority of the Ministry of Defense, is responsible for maintaining civil order around metropolitan areas and providing law enforcement services in rural areas.''
