## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  see Agamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The UK government has enacted two new sets of regulations, the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020, and the Coronavirus Act. Both enable several emergency measures related to Covid-19. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) is here counted as the main legislation, as it provides the main limitations on freedom of movement, gathering and the closing of public places and business. This regulation is based on the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, which thus serves as the overarching legal instrument for these measures. Noteworthy is also that there are four separate such regulations for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the regulations are very similar and provides the same emergency measures capacity across the UK. This is a new law, and not a state of emergency declaration, and is therefore coded as 4.
Note that The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on July 3 2020 and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/684), which relaxed some emergency measures. It is still the initial one that counts as the primary legal instrument here, which has ended, but there is thus still emergency legislation in place in the UK. Under the no. 2 Regulations 2020 of 4 July 2020, more measures were added increasingly to stem the spread of covid 19 between July and September 2020. Between October 14 - November 4 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations was introduced, which categorized each local authority area under one of three levels of restrictions. This was revoked on November 5 and replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200), which enforced the nationwide second lockdown regulations (in effect until 1 December 2020). On 2 December the UK government replaced SI 1200 of November 5 with 2020 SI 2020/1374 which reintroduced a countrywide three-tier legal framework. These Regulations were set to expire at the end of 2nd February 2021, but was subsequently extended to 31 of march 2021. It was replaced on March 29 with the current regulation titled Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021, which is currently set to expire on 2021-06-30. 
All the aforementioned Regulations were introduced under the same legal instrument, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The slight difference in regulation also continues between England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who all have their own version of this regulation, all however being based in the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.

## Time limit end date (*emlimitdate*) 

*Question*: What is the offcial end date for the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the legal instrument defined in *emlaw*.  If the enhanced powers have no officially declared end date but have a natural sunset clause under the legal framework described in *emlaw* (e.g. every 30 days), code the date at which such an expiry would occur without review for extension. If the end date varies by provision, code the date when the final provision is set to expire. If there is no officially declared end date, leave blank.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the quarter, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No, not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 For health reasons, parliament worked remotely from 26 March 2020 to 21 April in 2020, but have resumed work although with limited number of MPs present at each time. Committees are also working, and the parliament have both amended and passed laws. In addition, claiming urgency, the secreterary of state has the power to make the regulations come into force immediately, but the House of Commons needs to approve them within 28 days or it expires. The House also has the possibility to terminate it at any point before that. The emergency measures have thus not affected the parliaments law making role, and this is coded as 0. Note however that there has been significant critique toward the UK government for the lack of parliamentary scrutiny toward the measures taken, not least financial packages and spending. Furthermore, the system of operating where the government have enacted several measures through declarations in line with the legislation, and which have then only been subject to parliamentary approval after that (and as noted above, expires by itself after 28 days if the parliament has not voted on it). However, given that parliament continues to be involved in this process, it is not regarded as affecting their law making role. Neither is the law making role affected in other circumstances as far as has been found. Their capacity to scrutinize and oversee government actions, especially in terms of debates and referring questions to the government in relation to decisions, has been limited for various reasons (claiming urgency, the relatively few parliamentarians gathered at one point and the like), this does not impact law making directly, but rather relates to parliamentary oversight. This is therefore coded 0.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: 2020, Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 2

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been implemented across the UK and the response is more or less uniform. The city and the surrounding area of Leicester has been an exception from the beginning, due to the high prevalence of Covid-19 cases. Between July and September, the emergency measures differed slightly more; England for instance started some reopening that differed from other parts of the UK, such as opening school for some age groups and allowing a larger set of people to gather at the same place. These differences were relatively small though, therefore these periods are coded as 1. Since October 14 2020, the first Covid-19 tier regulations came into force, which split the UK in 3 different tiers followed by respective three levels of restrictions. This regulation was replaced by a more rigorous nationwide lockdown regulations on November 5 (until December 1). However, a national countrywide three-tier legal framework was reintroduced on 2 December 2020: ''The government will replace them on 2 December with a regionally-differentiated approach, where different tiers of restrictions apply in different parts of the country. These tiers will be strengthened compared to the previous tiers in order to prevent a return to growing infections''. This tier system was in place until March 29 2021, and the relative sub-national variation continued within England, as well as sub-national variation caused by somewhat different restrictions in the four different countries. For Q2 of 2021, there still remain some sub-national variation, but now pertaining to differences in the speed and phasing of opening up and loosening restrictions. This is therefore coded 2 for both Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well.

## Discriminatory measures (*discrim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 It has been reported that people of color in England and Wales were disproportionately fined by police forces for breaking lockdown rules in 2020. This has rendered debate in 2021, and MPs have argued for the fines to be revoked and the system changed in order to be lawful and not discriminatory. It is unclear to what extent the discrimination has continued during the coded period, but no evidence has been found suggesting that the discriminatory fining of some minorities has ceased, and this is therefore coded 1 for all periods. 
There has also been much debate and criticism about the adverse effect of the pandemic and the restrictions in UK on different minorities and women, but these are not the result of active discrimination within the measures adopted, and thus not accounted for here.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Time period: 2020, Q4*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q1*: 1

 
*Time period: 2021, Q2*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Reporters Without Borders report that: ”Reporters are also facing restrictions in covering the government’s daily press briefings, during which the Prime Minister or another designated official provides updates to the public on the Covid-19 situation in the country. Journalists are limited to virtual participation, and their microphones are almost always cut immediately after an initial question, with follow-up questions rarely allowed - severely limiting their ability to rigorously question the presiding official.” (1). Furthermore, there are reports that medical personnel have been ordered not to speak publicly about their work and the situation at hospitals, limiting media's access to information within these areas. The Media Freedom Rapid Response also reports that the UK government has banned openDemocracy, the Sunday Times and prevented other outlets from asking questions at the daily news briefings. While some of these issues seem to mainly pertain to the first periods (at least in terms of reports on it), the issue of the limitation in freedom of information remains. For instance, editors for several large news outlets expressed strong concern over the lack of following through on FOI-requests in February 2021. As there is no indication that the situation has improved, this is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*)

However, on November 5 2020, ''Journalists and photographers covering an anti-lockdown protest in London were ordered to leave and threatened with arrest by police. Photographers covering the event had reported that police were “hostile and very aggressive” towards members of the press throughout the evening'' (2). A similar situation occurred on March 23 2021 in Bristol, where a police officer threatened two members of the press who covered a protest in Bristol. This protest was however not related to Covid-19, and is thus not accounted for here. As the event on November 5 seems like an isolated incident, this is coded 0 for the rest of the periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have not reported any incidents of violence in enforcing emergency measures, and there are no other indiciations of such violence in the emergency measures. In November 2020, there have been several police arrests during anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protests. There have also been protests in 2021, but the reports on these do not record any excessive force, rather that protesters have harmed police officers when protesters turned violent. There has also been critique toward the police during a vigil in London after the murder of Sarah Everard, but it remains contested whether police used excessive force as the event was not allowed and they were ordered to disperse. As it remains unclear whether the arrests made were excessive or not, this is coded 0 here. Thus, this is coded 0 for all periods.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: During this quarter, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 The British military has aided the emergency response in several ways, but have not been involved in enforcing emergency measures.
