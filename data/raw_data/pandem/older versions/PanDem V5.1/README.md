# The Pandemic Backsliding Project (PanDem), Version 5.1

This repository contains the data, comments and sources for the PanDem dataset V5.1. It covers the period from March 2020 to December 2020. Download the repository including the codebook and data by clicking the green clone or download button.


## Background

Emergency provisions - such as the ones in place in many countries during the current Covid-19 crisis - enable states to temporarily limit personal freedoms and checks and balances to react effectively in situations of crisis. However, previous research shows that some leaders abuse such tools to foster more permanent autocratization by (a) imposing measures that are disproportionate to the severity of crises and (b) keeping emergency provisions in place once the factual situation improves (see [LÃ¼hrmann and Rooney, 2020](https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/31/1d/311d5d45-8747-45a4-b46f-37aa7ad8a7e8/wp_85.pdf)). How can states effectively respond to crises without undermining democratic standards, freedom and human rights? 

The Pandemic Backsliding Project (PanDem) tracks state responses to the Covid-19 pandemic as illustrative of the varieties of emergency measures and their execution, addressing how these decisions affect short- and long-term prospects for the political regime and democracy. 

This repository contains the data and sources for the PanDem project. The time series version of the dataset (V5) can be accessed [here](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/pandem/tree/master/csv_files/PanDem_ts_V5.1.csv). The file contains separate entries for each quarter of the year 2020, which are labeled as Q2, Q3, and Q4. These correspond to the periods March to June (Q2), July to September (Q3), and October to December (Q4). To access the cross-section version of the dataset, click [here](https://github.com/vdeminstitute/pandem/tree/master/csv_files/PanDem_ts_V5.1.csv). The cross-section version provides, for each country, the maximum level of violations that were recorded over the full observation period, from March to December.

# What's new in this version

Version 5.1 of the dataset fixes an issue in the previous version of the time-series dataset (PanDem_ts_V5.csv) in which the value of some indicators reflected their summary value over the three quarters instead of their contemporaneous value. This issue did not affect the indices (PanDem, PanBack, and Types 1 to 7), which are unchanged from Version 5.
