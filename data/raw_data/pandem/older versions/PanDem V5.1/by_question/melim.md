*Comments*:
 Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

LAW 20-06 AMENDING THE PENAL CODE - The amendments increase prison sentences for defamation, and introduce new penalties including prison sentences for the dissemination of false information. Under the amendments, new offenders face prison sentences of between one and three years. In addition, penalties are heightened if the offence takes place “at a time of a public health lockdown or a natural, biological or technological catastrophe or any other form of catastrophe,” with first time offenders facing up to five years in prison.

The Algerian government, in an attempt to curb the very real dangers caused by dis- and misinformation disseminated by conspiracy theorists and fabulists has been to pass a new law criminalising the broadcast of “fake news” deemed harmful to “public order and state security”. The law, approved by parliament on 22 April, 2020, has come in for criticism by free speech activists, who point out that it could be used to curb independent reporting of the government’s failings in tackling the pandemic. These deficiencies, such as the lack of adequate preventative measures in hospitals, have prompted some doctors to post videos on social media in which they draw attention to the difficult circumstances they are working under. The new law could be used to suppress such reports.''

*Comments*:
 March-June: Decree on the state of emergency obliged media outlets to refer only to official government sources on covid-19 (Decree 298). The measures were amended on 24 March (Decree 345) where some provisions were removed but the measures still required media outlets to reflect the government's position. The measures applied until 13 April when the state of emergency (but not the media measures) was extended. The Minister of Justice issued a statement that the measures might be restored, which did not happen (the state of emergency ended on 11 September). Melim is therefore coded as 3 in the March-June period.

 July-September, October-December: no measures limiting media freedom found.

*Comments*:
 According to OSCE report, Azerbaijan is among the countries that "have introduced and/or applied provisions to criminalize the dissemination of so-called “false information” or “false news” about the pandemic. According to a report by the Law Library of Congress, these are Laws Nos. 27-VIQD, 28-VIQD, and 30-VIQD from 17 March. For example, "Law No. 28-VIQD amends the Criminal Code (CC) by adding article 139-1, which criminalizes “[a] violation of the anti-epidemic, sanitary-hygienic, and quarantine regimes that causes, or creates a substantial threat of, the spread of disease." Since this legislation is not part of emergency measures but rather amendments to permanent legislation, it is not coded under melim.

Since it is existing legislation, it is not considered in the coding.

*Comments*:
 The Decree nº 4200 Article 13 states that "People who incite non-compliance with this Supreme Decree or misinform or generate uncertainty for the population, will be subject to criminal charges for the commission of crimes against public health". On May 7, it was altered via Decree nº 4231 to "People who incite non-compliance with this Supreme Decree or disseminate information of any kind, whether in written, printed, artistic and/or by any other procedure that endangers or affects public health, generating uncertainty in the population, will be liable to complaints for the commission of crimes typified in the Penal Code". The vague formulation of the measure allowed for not only stopping disinformation, but also limiting any type of reporting. Amnesty International, HRW and Civicus argued that this measure threatened freedom of expression. There is no evidence that it was used to limit media freedom, but there are accusations that it was used to persecue political adversaries. Due to public pressure, on May 14 the Decree nº 4236 repealed the provisions.

 Relaying information coming from a non-government source is a punishable offence: "Section 30(3) of Botswana's Emergency Powers Act states that "Any person who relays any information to the public about COVID-19 from a source other than the Director of Health Services, and the WHO commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding P100 000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to both." These restriction means that media outlets would only have 2 sources to look into and use when reporting on the nature of the Covid-19 virus."

 The emergency measures do not place de jure limitations on media, but Myanmar has previous de jure limitations on media that has been used to restrict reporting on Covid-19. Article 505 of the Penal Code states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is illegal and can result in prison up to two years. This, however, is not a part of the emergency response and was in place before the Covid-19 crisis, and no sources state that Myanmar has introduced any new de jure limitations since then, so this is coded as 0 for all three periods.

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures that have been in place since 2017 do restrict media freedom in multiple ways. The restrictions include 
1: Requiring online newspapers to register for permits to continue publishing.
2: Requiring media outlets to deposit sums (depending on the type of media) to bank accounts. The sums are high and act as deterrents to independent outlets.
3: The Supreme Council for Media Regulation has the power to block or suspend personal accounts if it decides that they are publishing or broadcasting fake news.
4: Art 3 of the State of Emergency Law 1958 states that once the state of emergency is imposed, the President has the right to put limitations on fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, assembly, residence and traffic in certain places or times. The same article allows for the surveillance of all forms of "correspondence" and expression, including newspapers and other publications before publication, and the power to shut down publication houses and confiscate materials for "public safety or issues of national security"
5: Recently, the authorities have also warned that those who spread "false news" about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines.

*Comments*:
 Reporters without borders report that: "The Covid-19 National Management Office (the government body set up to combat the coronavirus) and the press department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance have issued a communiqué announcing that "no newspapers will be printed until further notice." Officially, this is to ensure respect for the government's social distancing measures, because 'the distribution of printed newspapers and magazines requires physical interaction between individuals, journalists, printers and distributers, and this interaction could potentially facilitate the spread of the virus.'". This is thus a part of the national emergency response, and a de jure limitation on the media by banning all printed media. However, as it does not hinder them from publishing news online, it does not count as a major de jure limitation, and is therefore coded as 1.
No evidence has been found that this ban has been revoked, and it is thus assumed to be continuing.

 Coded as 0 since there are no national-level measures that limit media freedom. According to the decision to declare a state of emergency in certain areas (from 25 March until 10 May), the authorities can control media outlets to prevent the escalation of the situation. These measures are not considered in the coding since they do not apply to the whole country.

The authorities also submitted a draft bill on false information, which was adopted by the parliament but not accepted yet by the president; the law has been retured to parliament by the president on 3 August for further legislative work.

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).Consequently, the decree makes it punishable to report in any way on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes. Furthermore, it regulates which media outlets shall report on the Covid-19 situation and government response. This is therefore coded as 3 - the emergency measure de jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the governments position.No evidence has been found that this regulation having been repealed or amended, and is therefore assumed to still be in place.

 In the state of emergency declared from 18 March, it stated that "members of the press shall refrain from publishing 'fake news'". The determination of 'fake news' remains undefined (1). A copy of Legal Notice 37 which reinstated the state of emergency on 15 April could not be located online - therefore the coding is conservative to assume that it contained the same restrictions, as this acted as an extension of the prior state of emergency without legislative approval (legislature was dissolved) (2). Likewise, a copy of Legal Notice 40 of 2020 could not be located - however, Legal Notice 41 and 68 on Public Health (COVID-19) Regulations 2020 states that "no person shall publish or spread false information" under section 12(6) (3,4). We code this conservatively, assuming that the Public Health (COVID-19) Regulations 2020 reissued in October 2020 also contain the same regulation (unable to locate a this time).

*Comments*:
 On April 29,  Liberia's solicitor general said that the government would shut down news outlets and seize equipment from journalists alleged to have disseminated fake news. Also, media are forced to suspend printing due to lockdown restrictions, thus limiting their reach.

Also, the Liberian constitution, article 15a: "Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression ... save during an emergency declared" Article 86a: "...the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees..." But the measures themselves have been argued to explicitly target fake news and violations of lockdown.

No evidence was found that the situation has changed.

 The text of the Law  n ° 91-011 of July 18, 1991 relating to exceptional situations, mentions:
Art. 17 - The proclamation of the emergency situation automatically confers on the President of the Republic the power, by regulatory means:
                6. To take all measures to ensure the control of the press of publications and broadcasts of all kinds and to prohibit those which are likely to disturb public order or endanger national unity;

The Decree N ° 2020 –359 of March 21, 2020 proclaiming a state of health emergency, mentions:
Article 4.- The Minister of National Defense...... the Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Development, the Minister of Communication and Culture,......are each responsible as far as he is concerned, of the execution of this decree.

''...the Malagasy authorities have taken some of the most restrictive measures for the media in Africa. Radio stations and television channels are obliged to broadcast official information on the coronavirus, under penalty of sanction. This directive should not be subject to any restriction on the information that the media may publish according to the Minister of Communication. Free-to-air programs giving voice to listeners were also banned as part of the state of health emergency.''

The Madagascan authorities, responding to accusations of restricting media freedoms (see more on this on the following media variables), said:

"The press is one of the services that are automatically requisitioned"
If Madagascan journalists are worried about this tense context, the Minister of Communication wants to clarify the situation. "There is absolutely no restriction of their freedom of expression per se, but - it is true and we assume it, because that is the law which authorizes and which says it - the press is part of the services that are requisitioned as part of a state of emergency , justifies Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy. So we ask all the media in Madagascar to disseminate information on everything related to the coronavirus without asking them for any restriction in the information they can publish."

The state of emergency was lifted on October 18 2020, therefore also the media limitations based on it.

 March-June: Media outlets are obliged to only use information on covid-19 from the competent public authorities in order to limit disinformation. IPI reports that the decree orders "all media not to print or broadcast any “personal opinions” about COVID-19 during the state of emergency." According to ICNL, "During the state of emergency, all audiovisual media providers under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Moldova are required to present the official position of the competent public authorities (World Health Organization, Exceptional Situation Commission of the Republic of Moldova, the Government of the Republic of Moldova, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection). All presenters, moderators, and editors must not express their own opinion on topics concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure "maximum accuracy and correctness." 

July-September: no measures limiting media freedom found.

October-December: no measures limiting media freedom found. Media outlets were recommended to inform the population on emergency measures (Resolution 33 from 28 September).

*Comments*:
 On April 29, Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: ”Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 000 togrogs for a person or 5 000 000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable” (Section 5.13.1). Note that 500 000 togrogs is approximately 185 american dollars, and 5 000 000 togrogs aprooximately 1850 american dollars. As the current pandemic is regarded such a case of crisis, a person can be punished with fines if "disseminating false information" on the crisis. However, no other de jure limitations on media have been found in Mongolias emergency response. Therefore, this is coded as 1 - a de jure limitation on media restricted to making some limitations on the reporting on Covid-19.
No evidence has been found that this law has been abrogated or amended during the second an third period, and the law text is still in place on the Mongolian law website (https://www.legalinfo.mn/law/details/12695). This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 With the Decree No. 2-20-292 of March 23 on special provisions for a State of Health Emergency, the government is enabled to ... take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

Also, in a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news (the statement is found in the link in arabic). The Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions starting on Tuesday, May 26.  

In addition, on March 19, 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on April 27, 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on May 4, 2020.

 A presidential proclamation on 17 April 2020 made amendments to the emergency regulations to include provisions against false reporting. A person commits an offence if that person publishes any false or misleading statements about or in connection with the covid-19. This provision did not end immediately after the end of the state of emergency. It continued being included in the first measures taken after September 17 2020, on September 24 2020 (see 3), but was later removed with the amendment of September 28 (see 4), with the GN 235/2020 (GG 7346).

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures did initially not include any de jure limitation on the media. However, after the implementation of a new emergency law, the National Pandemic Act, on June 16, some de jure limitations were imposed. The Law states under Section 47 that ”A person commits an offense if the person … knowingly gives false or misleading information, or … recklessly disseminates false or misleading information to the public in relation to a Public Health Emergency”. Being found guilty of any of the offenses under Section 47 (which includes other offenses as well) can result in penalties of fines up to 50 000 Kina, and imprisonment for up to five years. 
This is a direct limitation of media reporting on Covid-19, as it bans ”false and misleading information”, but since this is vaguely formulated, this could very well be used to prosecute reporting on Covid-19 more generally. This is coded 2, as it limits media reporting to a large extent, but does not control it completely.

*Comments*:
 Based on amendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code from 31 March 2020 (100-FZ), dissemination of "false information" can be punished with a fine or jail sentence, which IPI argues is a "fake news" law that can be used to limit freedom of the media. According to the Council of Europe, "Media organisations will face fines of up to 5 million rubles (€62,000), that may rise up to 10 million rubles (€124,000) for repeated offences. Individuals will face criminal prosecution that may lead to severe financial penalties (e.g. fines equivalent to the person’s total income over the last 18 months) and prison sentences for up to 5 years."

Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, Art 207 mentions that it is applicable towards information regarding events that threaten security and safety of citizens, which includes epidemics. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

 While there hasn't been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals for spreading false informationabout COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.

 I found no emergency measures that limit media freedom. According to Reporters without Borders, "Under the amendments to the Administrative Code voted by the Tajik parliament on 10 June, anyone providing  “false” or “inaccurate” information about Covid-19 in the media or on social media could be fined up to 1,160 somoni (995 euros) – nearly twice the minimum monthly wage."  Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, applies to "false" information on infectious diseases in general, and constitutes permanent amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

According to IPI, "The lower house of parliament in Tajikistan voted in favour of making it an administrative offense to spread “inaccurate” and “untruthful” information about the COVID-19 pandemic through media or the internet. Individuals who are found to breach the rules face fines of up to 580 somoni (€49), while legal entities, such as media outlets, will be forced to pay 11,600 somoni (€998)."

Moreover, IPI also argues that the provisions of the new law are vague and "do not provide clear guidance on how the government is to determine the falsity of information. Civil society and media organizations, both in Tajikistan and internationally, have warned that, in practice and without an expert commission, the only information which will be considered “accurate and truthful” will be information provided by the government. They have also expressed the concern that the law would be used to prosecute activists and journalists."

In March, the government issues a list of prohibitions under the state of emergency, including vague restrictions on press freedom that can be enforced by prosecution: "Reporting or spreading of information regarding COVID-19 which is untrue and may cause public fear, as well as deliberate distortion of information which causes misunderstanding and hence affects peace and order, or good moral of people, are prohibited." 

This information is obtained from Human Rights Watch. I have not been able to read the actual list of prohibitions as the entire document is in Thai and an English translation has not been made. The link to the prohibtions (in thai) has been added to the sources.

 There are no reports found that any of the emergency measures places any de jure limitations on media. While media freedom is heavily restricted in Turkey, and harassment is on-going during the pandemic, there are no reports that any de jure limitations have been imposed as a part of Covid-19 measures, or during the pandemic.

 "It is forbidden for any individual to publish, re-publish or circulate medical information or guidance which is false, misleading or which hasn't been announced officially ... using print, audiovisual or social media, or online websites or any other way of publication or circulation". The order is strictly limiting the information someone is allowed to publish as it has to be previously announced by the government. It is not clarified whether journalist are excluded of this order.

*Comments*:
 I found no emergency measures that limit media freedom. The parliament passed ammendments to the Criminal Code (Article 244) on 23 March 2020 making spreading false information about infections punishable with a fine or imprisonment. Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, applies to "false" information on infectious diseases in general, and constitutes permanent amendments to existing legislation. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

 I did not find any information related to this. But  a new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of "fake news" or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  The OHCHR have reported that the law has been used to summon over 600 Facebook users for questioning over online posts about Covid-19. At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000.

 The production of "fake news" is prohibited in Zambia since before the Covid-19 crisis, and will thus not be included in this score as it is not part of the current emergency measures. No evidence that the covid-19 emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom was been found.
