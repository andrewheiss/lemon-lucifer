*Comments*:
 There have been variations in lockdown measures and movement restrictions in different parts of Afghanistan depending on the prevalenceof Covid-19 in the different areas. However, evidence of these differences are found from March 2020 to May 2020. The restrictions were eased after this period and I have not found additional information on the measures that have been introduced by the government.

*Comments*:
 Initial measures were the same for the whole country. The easing of restrictions varies depending on the municipality, with some municipalities designated as "green areas" from 27 April in the first wave and from 4 May in the second wave. Separation of the areas into low and high risk areas ended by 1 June 2020. No new information found since June 2020.

*Comments*:
 While it is the states and territories that enforce and control many of the emergency measures, the coordination through the National Cabinet (the federal government and all state and territories cooperation unit) is in place to coordinate and integrate the response to Covid-19, and the sub-national variation seems to be fairly small. For instance, there have been differences in how many people you can invite to your home, how many that are allowed to gather outdoors etc., but these variations have not been substantial and for those that have had comparatively relaxed restrictions, these have still been accompanied by strict demand of keeping distance etc. Therefore, this is coded as 1 for all threee periods.

*Comments*:
 In Belgium, there is subnational variation in certain measures and dates when these measures were adopted, based on each Province and Region. Belgium is a federal state, therefore apart from the measures that the federal government took, many of the regional governments enacted their own measures. 
However, the main restrictions such as the lockdown and night curfew have been nationwide.

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually, but these did not apply to the whole territory (no national-level response). The first 11 measures that we taken at the Council of Ministers on march 17, 2020, were general in nature and applied to the national level. Also, their duration was indefinite. But the more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the covid19 health cordon , applied to the affected areas. 
The health cordon was lifted on May 11. Since then, there are some basic measures in place like mandatory wearing of masks or air borders' closure, which are nationwide. (1)

Health cordon: taken on March 23, is established to count from Monday March 30, 2020 at 00h, a sanitary cordon around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic that are Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 

ON April 14, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: After the evaluation of the measures taken by the Government as part of the response to the CORONAVIRUS pandemic (Covid-19), the cordon cordon established as of March 30, 2020 is maintained until Monday April 27, 2020 at midnight.
The said cordon is extended to new localities and now includes the following municipalities: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro -Missérété, Adjara, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).

*Comments*:
 Many of the emergency measures have been enforced nationwide. However, there have been variation in that curfews initially were only placed in three regions (Yangon, Ayeyawaddy, and Nay Pyi Taw). On september 26, the government also implemented special stay at home orders in several townships. This is therefore coded as 2, there has been some sub-national variation, for all three time periods.

*Comments*:
 The initial and main emergency responses, such as curfews, bans on gatherings, closing of workplaces and so on, have been taken by the Canadian provinces and territories, and not the federal government. However, the government has coordinated a lot of work, and many efforts (school closings, curfews) occurred at the same time or within days of each other.  Furthermore, the measures taken have been largely similar within the states. However, the reopening of, and subsequent reentrance of restrictions, has varied between areas and over time depending on Covid-19 situation. As far as have been found, this variation has been fairly constant during the coded period, and this is therefore code 2 - some sub-national variation - for all three periods.

 No sub-national variation.''CAR authorities imposed restrictive measures early on: border closures (with the exception of the Bangui-Bouar-Garoua-Mboulaye line), closure of places of worship, schools and universities, night clubs and dance halls, a ban on groups of more than 15 people, a ban on handshakes and embraces, systematic hand washing at the entrance to public buildings, restrictions on population movements to the hinterland, etc. These barrier measures taken for 15-day periods have been constantly renewed and reinforced as the pandemic spreads. According to the latest news (June 12, 2020), the country has now enforced the compulsory wearing of masks in public spaces.
The same measures continued being in place during July-November.

 Constitution: Article 93:1b allows for the subnational variation that is manifested in the declared state of emergency in the Tigray region. Furthermore, the Tigray region is planning to hold an election, although this was cancelled at the national level due to the pandemic. According to the US embassy in Ethiopia, the regional measures differ.



Also, the Omoro region had very restricted access to internet and phone service between January 7 and April 1. This was however not part of the country's covid-19 strategy and is not included in the score for this question.

A state of emergency has been declared in the Tigray region in November because of the war. It is not part of the country's covid-19 strategy.

 No record of sub-national variation has been found in the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep periods. There was a lockdown of the Uusima-region, but this only pertained to moving in and out of the region, and had no impact on the emergency measures within each region as these stayed the same. However, in October some measures regarding restaurant businesses and the number of people allowed to gather were imposed in only some regions, based on the number of Covid-19 cases. This is therefore coded as 1 for this period, as there are sub-national variation in terms of a few issues.

*Comments*:
 The federal government have coordinated a lot of the emergency response and implemented a set of measures during the pandemic that have resulted in a fairly similar response across most states. However, some states such as Bavaria and Thuringia have taken more far reaching responses at times, and there are also other states in which differing emergency measures have been imposed. While there thus are some states that do differ a lot from most others, the measures taken have not been so different across the states that it results complete or almost complete sub-national variation during any of the periods, and this is therefore coded as 2.

*Comments*:
 The measures taken in March - June 2020, particularly the lockdown but also the closing of all non-essential services, applied countrywide. A few different extra measures were introduced locally in relation with covid19 cases' distribution (see 1, 2, 3).
In July - September 2020, when the previous measures had been lifted, the government started taking gradually local measures to deal with a new surge of covid19 cases in places with high number of covid19 infections such as Athens, Thessaloniki, and several islands. These measures gradually included the closing of bars and restaurants in those infected areas and a 50-person limit for public gatherings. In addition, some nationwide measures were also introduced, like the mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces (see 4, 5, 6).
In the October- December period, the government started by increasing local covid19 measures in highly infected areas (such as Thessaloniki and Athens at first), but in November 2020 ended up in reimposing a nationwide lockdown and a night-time curfew from 09:00pm to 5am (see 7,8,9,10).

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency has been implemented throughout the national territory, as most covid19 measures, with a few exceptions. All travel was banned from Conakry - where most COVID-19 cases have been confirmed - to the rest of the country for the periods March-June and July-September. 
Despite the extension of the state of emergency, some COVID-19 restrictions in the country after October have been eased. Individuals remain required to wear face masks in public and private spaces. The existing 00:01-04:00 (local time) curfew in Greater Conakry, which includes Conakry, Coyah, and Dubreka, remains in effect.

 A 21 day national lockdown was imposed by Prime minister Narendra Modi in March 2020 using the National Disaster Management Act. Outside of this, the different states have also been responding to Covid-19 with different measures. 



 Examples



1: The region of Himachal Pradesh banned entry of foreign and domestic tourists on 19 March till further notice. However, this ruling has not been uniform through out India.



2: The government in Odisha mandated the closures of educational institutions, cinema halls and public swimming pools and gyms by invoking the provisions of Epidemic Diseases Act. This has also not been exercised on a national level.

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 In the Mar-Jun period, Iran's emergency measures have been implemented nationwide by the government, and no sub-national variation in these measures have been found. This is therefore coded as 0 for this period. In the Jul-Sep period, a little sub-national variation was introduced in that lockdown measures were reintroduced in Tehran on July 15 due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. This period is therefore coded as 1. Finally, in the Oct-Dec period, more sub-national variation has emerged as new restrictions came in place in 25 of the 31 regions, as well as imposing new curfews in 31 cities, including Tehran. For this period, this is therefore coded 2.

*Time period: Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Several measures have been taken for the whole country, such as school closing, curfews,  limiting public gatherings, but there has also been much regional variation. Baghdad and Najaf have imposed curfews and lockdowns beyond the national-level emergency response, and the Kurdish region of Iraq has have also imposed significant emergency measures such as lockdowns and limitations on movement. These regional differences seem to be fairly constant throughout the periods. Considering that much response has been taken at the national level as well, this does not count as a complete sub-national variation, and therefore coded as 2.

*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Initially, the emergency measures were taken nationwide with no sub-national variation. In the Jul-Sep period, however, some sub-national variation occurred as some specific measures were implemented in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and subsequently also Dublin and Donegal, Calvan and Monaghan. This sub-national variation also carried over to the Oct-Dec period, and constituted differences in limitations on public gatherings, travel restrictions, attendance at public places etc. Several emergency measures have still been conducted nationwide though, and for instance the situation was deemed a level 5 emergency (the max) for the whole country in October, followed by nationwide restrictions again. Therefore, this is coded 0 in the Mar-Jun period, and 2 in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period as some variation in important aspects of the restrictions were introduced, alongside uniform restrictions across the country.

 The emergency measures have mostly been taken nationwide. However, some regions and areas have been subject to further restrictions and measures than the country as a whole in the Jul-Sep period, where some sub-national variation existed. This sub-national variation has as far as have been seen not travelled into to Oct-Dec period, where it is again uniform measures across the country. This is therefore coded 2 in the Jul-Sep period, and 0 in the others.

# Italy

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 Although the Italian Government have had numerous national response measures, the regional variation has during the Mar-Jun period differed substantially, most notably in the beginning of the spread of the Virus where only the Northern regions were in lockdown. While several measures later spread to all of Italy's regions, these large discrepancies in emergency responses between regions at parts of the development is enough to code this as 3, that there is substantial sub-national variation. However, in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods, measures seem to have conformed more. Although sub-national variation still exist, and some regions have seen reentrance of some measures that others have not, there are several nationwide measures implemented (of lifted across the nation) during these periods. This is therefore coded 2 for this latter period.

*Comments*:
 Jordan's emergency measures have been implemented nationally, but some regions (Aqaba, Irbid, Karak, Ma’an, Mafraq and Tafila)  eased their lockdowns more than other regions in April, and in August the Ramtha region imposed curfews not in place in the rest of the country. Likewise, a number of regional measures have been taken in October and November, where lockdowns and various curfews have been put in place in specific areas or cities (alongside national measures). For the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep period, there is thus a smaller sub-national variation and coded as 1, whereas the Oct-Dec period sees some increase sub-national variation and coded as 2.

 For the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep period, the emergency measures have been taken nationwide and no sub-national variation has been found in Lebanon. This is therefore coded as 0 for these periods. For the Oct-Dec period however, some sub-national variation exists. In October, Lebanon reintroduced lockdown measures in October, starting with numerous townships and cities. In November, lockdown measures were instead imposed nationwide, effectively minimizing any sub-national variation. This is therefore coded as 1 for the Oct-Dec period, as there did exist some sub-national variation during October, but was met with more conforming measures later.

 The measures appear to have been implemented uniformly across the country. However, the emergency measures regarding Covid-19 allow the government "to declare any geographical area as a restricted area". See section 17(d) of Government Notice No. 48 (1) This could potentially allow for subnational variation in the emergency measures at some future date.

 Many measures have been taken nationwide in Malaysia. However, consistently throughout the periods there has been regional measures such as curfews, limits of public gatherings and lockdowns along with those measures taken by national government. Thus there has been some regional variation in emergency measures, but also some conforming measures. This is therefore coded as 2 for all three periods.

 During March-June, the measures overall applied natiuonwide, but with the following exceptions: travel into and out of the capital Nouakchott and in Kiffa (Assaba region) was banned due to a surge in reported coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases, and movements between different regions in the country were also prohibited, with the exception of movement between Nouakchott-Ouest, Nouakchott-Nord, and Nouakchott-Sud regions. A nationwide curfew between 21:00 and 06:00 (local time) and a suspension on all flights to and from Mauritania was in place in May. Border crossing points into the country, educational facilities, and all non-essential businesses were closed. 
After July 10, there are mainly preventative measures in place like social distancing guidlines and mandatory wearing of masks.

 There have been some variations. For example, temporary bans on transport and gatherings were introduced in the capital of Kathmandu on 19 August 2020 due to increasing cases of Covid-19. 

There was a lockdown in kathmandu Valley which was extended to September 16. I have not found more information on lockdowns in Nepal after the September 16 extension. I have not found other kinds of variations in other emergency measures on a sub-national level. As a result, I have coded this variable as 0 in the Oct/Dec period.

*Comments*:
 The measures in March-June were overall uniform, including the lockdown, except for a few cases: ''Transport between different provinces and the city of Kigali is permitted, except for movement to and from Rusizi and Rubavu districts. Public transport in Rusizi and Rubavu districts remains closed. Motos may carry passengers, except in Rusizi and Rubavu districts.''

Between July-September, the nationwide night curfew remained, but there were a few subnational differences in the measures: there was a local lockdown in six areas in Nyamagabe and Nyamasheke and travel restrictions were increased in Kigali and the western district of Rusizi, with public transport in and out of the capital being banned. The situation and the measures are similar for October and November, with a change in the night curfew hours.

*Comments*:
 During the first and second period, Saudi Arabia imposed several nation-wide emergence measures, but also a number of regional measures, primarily specific lockdowns and curfews (or easing of these). This is therefore coded as 2, as there's some regional variation along with several measures in place for the whole country. During the third period no variation was identified, and it is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 The Turkish government between March-June imposed curfews and lockdowns differently across the country, with stronger restrictions in highly populated areas. For example, on March 30, April 4, April 10, April 18 etc., different areas and cities were put under quarantine, lockdown, or were obliged to introduced mandatory face masks. In July-September and October-December the measures became more uniform and nationwide (nationwide curfew, weekend curfew and lockdown, mandatory face masks).

# United Kingdom 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been implemented across the UK and the response is more or less uniform. The city and the surrounding area of Leicester has been an exception from the beginning, due to the high prevalence of covid19 cases.
Between July and September, the emergency measures differed slightly more; England for instance started some reopening that differed from other parts of the UK, such as opening school for some age groups and allowing a larger set of people to gather at the same place. These differences were relatively small though, therefore these periods are coded as 1.
Since October 14 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations came into force, which split the UK in 3 different tiers followed by respective three levels of restrictions. This regulation was replaced by a more rigorous nationwide lockdown regulations on November 5 (until December 1). However, a national countrywide three-tier legal framework was reintroduced on 2 December 2020: 
''The government will replace them on 2 December with a regionally-differentiated approach, where different tiers of restrictions apply in different parts of the country. These tiers will be strengthened compared to the previous tiers in order to prevent a return to growing infections''.

*Comments*:
 The national emergency does not  determine how states respond to Covid-19, it opens up a lot of federal leeway to aid states and territories in differing ways and allows federal agencies to contribute to for example  health care and emergency actions. So it has been up to the states to themselves determine their response to the pandemic.  The states differ in terms of what and how many emergency measures and Covid-19 related regulation they have enacted, as is  shown both by the National Governors Associations compilation of policy and legislation in all states and territories, and  in the National Conference of State Legislatures (an interest organisation for legislatures) compiling of data on state legislation during the pandemic. While a lot of states have taken similar or the same actions on a number of areas, the overall difference - both in content and in the timing of initiating restricitons and beginning to lift them - lead the overall interpretation of the subnational variation to be coded as 3.

*Comments*:
 People living in different parts of Vietnam have been living with different types of restrictions depending on the Covid-19 situation in the different areas. For example, a lockdown was imposed in the city of Hai Duong on 14 August 2020 after new cases were found in the area from 7 August 2020. 

I have not found evidence of sub-national variation since September 2020.
