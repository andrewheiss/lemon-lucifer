 Journalist Natig Isbatov was arrested on 9 April 2020 and "jailed for allegedly violating lockdown regulations by filming a protest outside an employment office in Baku." Since 21 June 2020, new quarantine measures restricted journalists' freedom of movement since they had to obtain permissions to leave home, which likely placed restrictions on all reporting. Merepoth is therefore coded as 1 for March-June 2020, July-September 2020. 

Restrictions on journalists were removed in September (see meinf). Since the arrest of Natig Isbatov was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in October-December 2020.

However, the Digital Security Act which was introduced in 2018 has been increasingly used since March 2020 on journalists who have been reporting on Covid-19 and the government's response to the pandemic.

Reports explain that the law imposes serious restrictions on freedom of expression in Bangladesh.

# Burma/Myanmar

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has used Article 505 of the Penal code, which states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is punishable with up to two years in prison, to arrest and jail a journalist reporting on Covid-19, as well as having closed down over 200 websites by claiming that they have spread "fake news". As the regulation in use allows for any arbitrary interpretation of "fear or alarm to the public", and media outlets online are being closed down, this is deemed a de facto limitation on reporting on non-Covid-19 related news as well. Furthermore, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders in place during the fall of 2020, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both covid-19 and non covid-19-related news.  This is therefore coded 1 for all three periods.

 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist and charges on defamation, and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

Also, Chad's High Authority for Media and Broadcasting (HAMA) asked in September and October 2020 many independent media outlets to comply with a provision of a law - the 2018 press law - that requires from media editors and publishers to at least have a postgraduate degree in journalism. The HAMA already closed 12 publications – a quarter of the Chad’s privately-owned print media outlets – at the start of September on the same grounds.

*Comments*:
 The Chinese government has maintained a very tight and highly controlled media since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reporters without Borders have reported how China’s state owned media is currently under the close control of the Community Party. While there are foreign journalists and news agencies working in China, they encounter multiple obstacles while working in the field. More than 100 journalists are currently detained in conditions that pose a threat to their lives. In this way de-facto limitations are already in place on media reporting.

Beijing has expelled least 14 international journalists since March 2020. Most recently, two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

 A Congolese reporter was arrested with charges of violating Covid-19 restrictions on May 9, 2020. He was filming a broadcast - unrelated to the pandemic.

''Faustin Mbiya, a journalist at Foundation Daniel Madimba radio station based in Mbuji-Mayi, was arrested on 9 May on his return from producing a broadcast in Tshilenge, 25 km to the east. He was freed on bail of 300,000 Congolese francs (160 euros) on 12 May pending trial on charges of “violating emergency health measures” and “insulting the provincial authorities.”'' (1)
''Faustin Mbiya wa Kabeya is accused of vilifying the governor in his broadcasts. Facts that the accused rejects.'' (2)

 I did not find information on this. However, media in Egypt is heavily censored. Critical journalists have routinely been arrested and the Supreme Council for Media Regulation (SCMR), Egypt’s main media regulator has blocked and limited access to multiple news websites and social media accounts.

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS du 10 avril 2020 désignant les services et les personnels essentiels du secteur public, parapublic et privé d’astreinte pendant l’état d’urgence lié au COVID-19'' (1) (Decree n°00106 designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to COVID-19), does not include journalists and the media in the listed essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures.

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by November 2020.

Authorities in Gabon have extended the country's State of Health Emergency measures for 45 days from Aug. 14, 2020. A nightly 2000-0500 curfew remains in effect.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing serious government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation and still exists.

*Comments*:
 No limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news.  However, after the July 2019 general election and New Democracy's party victory, public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA were placed under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis through a presidential decree. 

In addition, when the Greek government allocated €20 million to media outlets for them to carry “Stay at Home” public health messages, it outsourced the distribution of these funds to a private media shop company, bypassing its obligation to make public all transactions conducted by the state. After opposition parties  parliamentary watchdogs protested the lack of transparency, the government in early July, released the list containing the amounts given per media outelt, it was revealed that outlets critical of the government received less than 1 percent of the total sum, compared to pro-government outlets, and one particularly anti-government outlet was excluded entirely from the funding. (1).

Also, ''media in Greece rank among the least trusted by the public, compared to other countries in Europe.... a combination of ownership issues, drastic cuts in costs and jobs, and a peculiar relationship to political power, has produced a deeply problematic media landscape, where unbiased, dispassionate coverage is hard to find....During Covid19, the partisanship of Greek media played out even more intensely. Stories about government contracts that were handed out in less than clear circumstances were featured only in a handful of independent, alternative outlets. Scrutiny over how the government would meet the challenge of building up a public healthcare system devastated by years of cuts was likewise absent from the majority of the media. Questions over the government’s implementation of safety protocols for travelers from abroad were largely unasked...'' (1).

Daniel Bastard, head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk has said that ‘In this directive, the Indonesia police are taking advantage of the need to combat disinformation linked to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to rein in journalists who might want to publish information critical of President Joko Widodo or his government

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities de-facto attempting to limit reporting about the about the coronavirus. Also, the media environment in Kenya faces many challenged and restrictions for journalists. 

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1, 2) 

''At least 10 journalists and digital content creators have been arrested or threatened with prosecution under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act 2018. They were accused of publishing and spreading false and alarming information on social media about the new coronavirus. At least 10 others were arrested under the Public Order Act, for allegedly flouting the curfew.'' (1)

''Journalists and media outlets in Kenya faced increased pressure after Uhuru Kenyatta assumed office in 2013. The current administration has continued to enact laws that undermine media freedom. Some of these laws are the Media Act, 2013, Kenya Information, Communication (Amendment) Act, 2013 and Security Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014. These laws imposed tough penalties on journalists and expanded offences for which they could be punished. The government's increased intolerance of the media culminated in the temporary shutdown of four independent TV stations after they covered former opposition chief Raila Odinga's symbolic presidential inauguration in 2017''.

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news in Laos, by making it  punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about  Covid-19 in Lebanon,  and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion introduce far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon)  This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on non Covid-19-related news with reference to Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

*Comments*:
 The Malaysian authorities have arrested journalists under Section 505 of the penal code (as well as other legislation), which bans statements causing "fear or alarm to the public". While this vague formulation could be used to prosecute journalists on non-Covid-19 related news as well, there is no reports found of that happening, and the authorities seem to only use this legislation to place de facto limitations on reporting on Covid-19 related issues as of yet. This is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of covid19.

''The decree enables the government to declare a "state of health emergency" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country's press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)".

In addition, on March 19, 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on April 27, 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on May 4, 2020.

As part of public health restrictions on assembly, 92 journalists had their access to the presidential villa suspended. Effectively stopping them from covering government press briefings. Since I did not find evidence of the violations discontinuing, merepoth is coded as 1 in all time periods.

There are reports that journalist were excluded from a hearing of the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes, however, this restriction was not with reference to the pandemic.

 Philippines’ biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air on 5 May 2020. The network had expected to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown. However the National Telecommunications Commission decided against renewing its 25 year franchise. Duterte has repeatedly threatened to stop ABS-CBN, and previously accused it of failing to broadcast his campaign advertisements. In a speech in December, he taunted the network, stating: “ABS-CBN, your contract is about to expire. If I were you, you’re better off selling it … I will make sure that you will remember this episode of our times for ever.”

 Wojciech Jakub Atys, a photographer for Gazeta Wyborcza, was asked to appear in court after taking pictures (alledgedly because of breaking social distancing rules) of a protest outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s home on 29 March that opposed changes to the electoral law. Another reporter for OKO.press website potentially faces a 13,000 fine for planning to cover a protest on 10 April outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s and "failure to respect social distancing and organising a public gathering." (the protest was planned but did not take place).  

July-September: Two independent journalists were refused accreditation to the President's trip to Italy "due to a lack of space caused by COVID-19 restrictions, in apparent retaliation for critical coverage. Media accused the office of the president of using the COVID-19 rules to side-line critical media." (IPI)

October-November: On 17 November 2020, Angelika Pitoń was covering protests and was charged with using "indecent" words towards the police and was not wearing a mask, as per Covid-19 regulations. "Pitoń said that the officers in Zakopane intervened because of an alleged violation of social distancing rules, yet her charges presented refer to not wearing a mask." (Council of Europe)

 The emergency measures and particularly the lockdown of March 21 (1) did not exempt journalists from moving freely to work, as it did not include the media in the essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions. (1)
The lockdown was eased in May, but after a rise in coronavirus cases it is since then being re-imposed in selected areas.

*Comments*:
 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on June 30, 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.''

 On 10 August, the Tanzanian government announced that broadcasting foreign content would be banned without government permission. This includes content about Covid-19. The government effectively controls the information that is published. However, this is not justified by any emergency response of the government, so it does not affect the score on this variable.

*Comments*:
 1: On May 22, Bangkok police arrested prominent pro-democracy activists Anurak Jeantawanich and Tosaporn Serirak for violating the ban on public assembly – one of the emergency measures imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The arrest was triggered by a remembrance service they held earlier that day with supporters of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship – known as the “Red Shirts” – to mark the 6th anniversary of the 2014 military coup. 

2: Thai authorities previously arrested Anurak on the same charges on May 13, when he held a remembrance service to demand justice for those killed and wounded by the military during the crackdown on the 2010 Red Shirts protests. Even though thermal scanners to detect fevers were provided at the events and participants wore face masks, the activists were accused of ignoring social distancing, acting in a way likely to spread the virus, and disobeying lawful orders in both cases. If found guilty, they face two years in prison and a 40,000 baht (US$1,250) fine.

3: In southern Thailand, local authorities in Songkhla province denied a request by villagers in Singha Nakhon district to hold a rally on May 24 2020 in protest of the government’s plan to build beach walls and breakwaters on Muang Ngam Beach. Despite an assurance from the organizers to follow social distancing and other Covid-19 measures to keep people safe, officials prohibited the rally.

As these incidents do not include professional journalists, this variable has been coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 The government is using the state of emergency to silence journalists who criticize the government. According to the Human Rights Watch: "Authorities have harassed, detained, and prosecuted political opponents, including several legislators, journalists who publish critical information, health workers who criticize the government’s handling of the pandemic (...). Security forces have also confiscated cellphones and laptops from journalists and forced them to erase photos or videos."

 A new cyber security law was passed by Vietnam's National Assembly. This law grants the governemnt power to limit online freedom. This law was introduced in 2018 prior to the start of the pandemic and hence is not related to Covid-19.
