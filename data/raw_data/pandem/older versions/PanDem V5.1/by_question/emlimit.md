*Comments*:
 March-June: Decisions by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 19 and 21 March (prohibition of gathering in public places) have a 30-day time limit. However, the decision by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 23 March (which "prohibits individuals from leaving their place of residence without a special permit, to be issued for very limited cases", "Odluka o zabrani napuštanja mjesta prebivališta i stalnog boravka u Republici Hrvatskoj") does not mention a time limit. I also did not find a time limit mentioned in press conferences or local media outlets. Moreover, an amendment to 23 March decision from 18 April explicitly mentions that "the necessary measure prohibiting leaving the place of residence and permanent residence in the Republic of Croatia shall be applied as long as there is a serious risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, ie until this Decision is repealed. " Although the decision was lifted on 11 May 2020, emlimit is coded as 0 since there was no time limit at the time the decision was passed and there is no explicit time limit in the legal instrument (the Civil Protection Act).

July-September, October-December: all measures taken under the Civil Protection act have a time limit.

 Although both the declaration and extension of states of emergency had a time limit,  not all measures implemented using Zákon č. 258/2000  (Act No. 258/2000 Coll) (which was used in all time periods) have a defined time limit.

*Comments*:
 Under Art 154 of Egypt's 2014 constitution, the president with parliamentary approval can declare a state of emergency for up to three months, with three-month extensions if approved by two-thirds of parliament. In this sense, there is an officially declared time limit. However, the current 596-member parliament is tightly controlled by intelligence agencies and dominated by the al-Sisi's supporters. It has acted largely as a rubber stamp for his policies with almost no opposition.

After the latest extension, the State of Emergency is to remain till 28 January 2021.

*Comments*:
 State of emergency was initially declared for 15 days. On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. After the new law, all measures and the state of emergency had a 45-day limit, and were being renewed. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on October 3 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. 
However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on November 15, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. The government according to media sources (see 1, 2) are seeking to prolong the existing measures until December 14, 2020, but it has not been yet validated.

Since the legal instrument that the measures are based on has a time limit until 1 January 2021  (Article 45 (3)  on "Temporary measures to be taken until January 1, 2021" of the Law of Georgia on Public Health), emlimit is coded as 1.

 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July.

*Comments*:
 Article 38 of the Israeli constitution, Declaring a State of Emergency, states that the Knesset can declare a state of emergency for a maximum time limit of one year (with possibility of extension), and that the government can declare a state of emergency with the maximum time limit of 7 days (with the possiblity of extension, and the possible termination of the state of the emergency if the Knesset votes in favour of ending it). This state of emergency is the latter, declared by the government, and thus had an initial time limit of 7 days although they have extended it afterwards.
Note that since July 21, there's a new (temporary) law regulating state's of emergency that gives government extended powers during an SOE, as well as the right to declare it for a longer time. See comments and sources under emleglimit for more information.

*Comments*:
 The Decree 2020-351 of March 23 2020 which declared a state of emergency, did not include a limit date, it only mentioned that this measure may be renewed if necessary. 
In some of the later Communiques by the Council of Ministers, a limit date and extension fo the state of emergency is mentioned, but it hasn't been found for all. 
e.g. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 04-29-2020: ''The Council adopted a decree extending the state of emergency. This decree, which is part of the implementation of the national response plan to the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, extends the state of emergency declared on March 23, 2020 throughout the national territory, for a new period from May 1 to May 15, 2020.'' 

In the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 09-30-2020 it is mentioned that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020, to continue the strategy of targeted screening and to protect patients. vulnerable and exposed people.''

*Comments*:
 Only one of the sources found on the state of emergency in Jordan report that there's a time limit on it (the Swedish Embassy), which states that it is initially imposed for two weeks with the possibility of extension. This is therefore coded as 1 in the Mar-Jun period. However, as no evidence has been found of any time limits after this period, and that the SOE is in place without any officially declared end date being found, this is coded 0 for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period.

 March-June: Both the declaration of the state of emergency and its extensions had a time limit. The state of emergency was declared from 16 March until 15 April 2020, on 15 April it was extended until 1 May, and on 29 April it was extended until 11 May.

July-September, October-December: measures implemented using the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system do not have a time limit, and were abolished when subsequent measures were passed.

For example, "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated August 15, 2020 No. 48 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" does not have a time limit and was abolished when "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated August 15, 2020 No. 48 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" was passed. The 15 August resolution does not have a time limit and was abolished when "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated October 23, 2020 No. 58 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" was passed (in place at the time of coding).

 Emergency situation: no time limit in the decision to declare emergency situation, 30-day time limit in the announcement by the Prime Minister on the news section of the government website. No time limit in the legal framework (the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018). On 9 May the President announced that emergency situation would be extended in a speech commemorating the anniversary of the end of World War II. The announcement from 10 May by the prime minister says that the emergency regime is still in place after the state of emergency in parts of the country has ended. OSCE report (p.162) says that "emergency situation" was declared for one month, was later renewed and is in place (the report was published on 17 July). I also found no evidence that the emergency situation has ended (e.g. local media reports that it is still in place). Since the official declaration of the emergency situation has no time limit (despite it being mentioned in the press statement), I coded emlimit as 0. According to Garda, " “On Friday, May 8, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov announced that the nationwide state of emergency currently in place due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic will be extended indefinitely. The state of emergency was originally introduced on Sunday, March 22.”"

State of emergency (part of the country): Chapter 2, Article 13 of the Constitution: 30 days limit for the whole country, 60 days for specific territories. Can be extended for the same period.  The state of emergency was extended and ended on 10 May 2020.

*Comments*:
 The decree was initially in effect up until April 19, but it seem to have been extended as measures taken under it were carried forward and other emergency measures that have been taken subsequently. As no extensions or end dates have been found after the initial one of April 19, this is coded 0 for all three periods, as none of them had an end date by the end of that period.

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (8). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (9). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (5). On 29 October, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months until 29 April 2021 (6). This also aligns with the initial decree being for 6 months.

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1).

*Comments*:
 The official statement announcing the state of epidemic says the state is in force until cancellation (based on order 491 from 20 March 2020, chapter 1, point 1). I found no time limit on the duration of the state of epidemic and the emergency measures in the order declaring a state of epidemic (Order 491 from 20 March 2020, http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000049101.pdf). The emergency measures that apply for the duration of the state of epidemic are covid-19 related measures such as restrictions on movement (border crossing and similar) (Chapter 2), Restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing and use of certain items (masks, disinfectant and similar) (Chapter 3),  Restrictions on the functioning of certain institutions or workplaces (Chapter 4) , Prohibition of organizing shows and other gatherings of the population (Chapter 5), access to real estate, premises and areas provided for by anti-epidemic plans (Chapter 6). 

The state of epidemic was declared based on “the Act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused” (from 7 March 2020, http://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000037401.pdf), which amended “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases” (5 December 2008). According to Article 36 of the Act from 7 March, Articles 3-6 (on remote work, additional care allowance, airport regulations and procurement) and Articles 10-14 (on central government’s authority to give orders to local governments, changes to construction, tourism and transportation industries) a 180-day time limit and Article 31 (on budget transfers) has a 365-day time limit. The rest of the provisions (related to the “functioning of the health care system, telecommunication or state's Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations”, https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/poland-report-covid-19-april-2020_en.pdf) amend existing regulations and are permanent changes to the “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases”.

According to OSCE report (p.36), "the end date of certain measures is uncertain." According to Democracy Reporting (p. 22), "The timing of these limitations is varied; some have been introduced with a set time limit and a  possibility of extension, some, like the ban on mass events, were introduced indefinitely."

The state of epidemic is also different from the state of emergency that has a 90-day time limit based on the Constitution (Article 230, point 1). While some specific emergency measures under a state of epidemic have a time limit, the state of epidemic was declared until further notice, therefore coded as 0.

 Some but not all measures have a time limit: 1) the declaration and implementation of emergency measures to the heads of regional authorities does not have a time limit and has not ended at the time of coding,  2) The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin.

 Emergency situation ("Mimoriadna situácia") was declared from 12 March 2020 based on "Zákon Národnej rady Slovenskej republiky o civilnej ochrane obyvateľstva" (paragraph 8) and has been in place since 12 March and is in place at the time of coding. The legal framework does not provide any time limit for emergency situation ("Mimoriadna situácia"). According to Democracy Reporting, "The emergency situation does not have a statutory time limit and it continues today [the report is from July 2020]." Although the states of emergency had a time limit, emlimit is coded as 0 in all periods because emergency situation applied since 12 March and has not ended at the time of coding.

*Comments*:
 Most but not all measures have a time limit (in all time periods). 

For example, in March-June: the decree restricting freedom of movement from 29 March 2020 had no time limit (Art.7), which was reviewed by the Constitutional Court (OSCE report. p.38). Moreover, according to European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, " On 29 May, the government adopted decision, in effect from 1 June, laying down that all adopted measures that have not been lifted by 1 June shall remain in force until they are amended or revoked, since there is still the risk of spread of the infection."

In July-September: the decree limiting public gatherings from 7 July 2020 had no time limit. According to a report by Democracy Reporting from 27 July, the implementation of the legal instrument in Slovenia has no explicit time limit.

In October-December: the decree restricting freedom of movement from 27 November 2020 had no time limit.

 The  Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act does not have an officially declared time limit. The measures have been implemented differently in difference areas of South Korea depending on the spread of Covid-19 in different areas. The country never imposed a lockdown. Preventative measures were used instead and these measures had time limits. These time limits were sometimes extended, removed and then re-introduced as the infection rates varied.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures (such as 1 August 2020, 1 September 2020), with some measures until 31 December 2020. Some measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister’s COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. As of 19 October, mass gatherings and events remain prohibited. Private events are permitted for 30-40 people." There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found).
