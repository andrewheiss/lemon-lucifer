 There have been reports on racial profiling in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures.

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May...Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

 Coded as 3 in all in periods because of ongoing distrimination against migrants. 

1) The official ban on movement of migrants has been implemented in Una-Sana Canton. In March-June: “IOM is obliged to implement measures to completely restrict the movement of users of temporary reception centers Bira in Bihać and Miral in Velika Kladuša, as well as to implement additional protection measures within temporary reception centers and education on the dangers of spreading coronavirus among the migrant population. The MUP USK will supervise the measures of restriction of movement.” The measures continued in July-September, and October. 


2) The official ban on movement of migrants has also been implemented in Sarajevo canon from 18 March: “By the same Decision, with the consent of the Commander of the Civil Protection Headquarters of the KS, which is performed by the Minister of Communal Economy and Infrastructure of the KS Nihada Glamoč, the Government introduced a ban on migrants from leaving the mentioned centers.” I have not found any evidence that the measures have been lifted.

3) De-facto discrimination in Tuzla: “The municipality, opposing assistance since the influx of people started, is fueling xenophobia and publicly advised everyone who had contact with refugees and migrants to self-isolate” (report from 29 April)

*Comments*:
 March-June 2020: Targeted discriminatory measures in Roma communities across the country, such as checkpoints and police patrols in Roma communities. According to the UN, the targeted Roma communities were Nova Zagora, Kazanlak, Sliven, Yambol, and Sofia. The measures were adopted de-jure by local councils (https://www.amnesty.sk/stigmatizujuca-karantena-romskych-komunit-na-slovensku-a-v-bulharsku/, also see order 12-201/17.03.2020 from Nova Zagora). Some areas (e.g. Burgas) used drones with thermal sensors for measuring temperature in quarantined Roma communities. The measures were announced at a press briefing by Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, the Head of the National Operational Headquarters (see video in an article by https://www.flashnews.bg/). The lockdown measures are still in place even after the state of emergency ended, such as in Yambol (Amnesty International). Coded as 3 (Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination).

Moreover, Reuters reports that Orthodox churches were allowed to stay open during Orthodox Easter celebrations. Since the exceptions applied only for Orthodox Easter (and not e.g. Catholic Easter), it can be considered a case of minor de-facto discrimination.

July-September 2020: According to Amnestry International (https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR1529612020ENGLISH.PDF), the measures were in place from March to July 2020. According to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights report (p.10, July version), the lockdown measures were extended until 8 July in Kyustendil. Since I have not been able to find evidence of extended measures in other areas, it is coded as 2 (Minor de-jure discrimination.) According to  European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights report (November version), "n September and October 2020 such measures were not applied".

October-December: since quarantine measures had a defined limit (with the latest being 8 July) and I found no evidence of further discrimination, coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 There are reports of some discrimination from law enforcement onto the Rohingyan population, who has been subject to harassment, as well as unlawful fines, when attempting to cross checkpoints that are part of the emergency measures. Similar reports are found in the second period, where Rohingyans and Rakhians have been subject to police targeting and extortion. However, no sources indicate that this is national or regional policy, or that there are any more severe or systematically imposed instances of de facto discrimination on going in relation to the Covid-19 emergency measures (the more severe discrimination of Rohingyans is from before the emergency measures and not part of the Covid-19 response, and thus not accounted for here). While no new reports of discrimination have been found in the Oct-Dec period, neither has there been any evidence that discrimination toward these groups have ceased or any indication that the situation has improved. This is therefore coded as 1, minor de facto discrimination, for all three periods.

 There are many reports on unsanitary conditions of quarantine establishments, but no human rights violations based on these democratic rights:
''The aid and medical sources said that most sites lack the necessary hygiene and sanitation infrastructure, are severely overcrowded, and raise the risk of the virus spreading unchecked.''
''Although police and local officials have quarantined Burundians and foreigners traveling into the country by air or overland in hotels, schools, and other buildings, Burundian authorities have failed to ensure adequate food, health care, hygiene, and sanitation in some locations. Some humanitarian organizations have been blocked from reaching and providing assistance to people in quarantine.''

However, people with African roots have been treated unfairly and discriminated against. Examples of discrimination: Businessman from Niger was made to take a coronavirus test. He was then ordered to self-isolate at home for 14 days although he had not left Guangzhou since the outbreak nor had any contact with known infected persons. People of African descent were denied entry to the subway system for two weeks starting April 10. They were being placed in quarantine. despite no recent travel history or other risk factors. Some had magnetic strips and alarms installed on their doors to deter them from leaving. They have also been barred from entering certain supermarkets and restaurants.

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and EU agency of fundamental righs have not reported any discrimination within the response to Covid-19, and no indications have been found of it.
Worth noting however is that there's been debate in Finland as to whether the measures discriminate elderly and people living in institutions. For example, people in insitutions have not been allowed to have visitors due to health reasons, which has been very hard on some groups.
But this is not a case of the emergency measures actively discriminating some group, and this is thus coded as 0.

*Time period: Q2*: 1

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The available information suggests that the enforcement of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in France had a disproportionate impact on members of racialized groups and residents of working class
neighbourhoods.'' (1)

''In Germany, Cyprus and Serbia, asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants in camps were targeted with selective quarantines, and with forced evictions in France and Greece.'' (4)

'''For example, in Nice, predominantly working class and minority ethnic neighbourhoods were subject to a longer night-time curfew than the rest of the city. The police enforcement of COVID-19-related restrictions on movement reinforced already existing discriminatory and unlawful policing trends in those neighbourhoods. In Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest department in mainland France and where most inhabitants are of North and West African origin, the number of fines for breaching confinement was three times higher than in the rest of the country. In the first day of lockdown, 10% of the fines issued were in Seine-Saint-Denis”. (1) 

''Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities....In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to the physical integrity of law enforcement officials or others. '' (1) 

'Since the beginning of the lockdown, many accounts, some corroborated by videos posted on social networks, reveal police stops that appear abusive, violent, and discriminatory, sometimes accompanied by racist insults.  Available official data, as well as information published in the media, also indicate a considerable concentration of police stops to enforce lockdown measures in “quartiers populaires” – working-class neighborhoods with a high number of visible minority residents and, for example, a fine rate three times as high as the national average in Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest neighborhood of Metropolitan France. The data and accounts suggest discriminatory behavior against citizens depending on where they live and a disproportionate impact of fines on socially and economically disadvantaged households, the organizations said.''

*Comments*:
 According to a report by Amnestry International (p.6): "Contrary to medical advice, religious gatherings have not been restricted  by law largely to ensure that the Georgian Orthodox Church could conduct liturgies for Orthodox Easter. During Palm Sunday and Easter celebrations on 12 April and 19 April in Georgia, several Orthodox churches hosted dozens of worshippers. All other religious groups in Georgia have voluntarily agreed to close their places of worship to the public. On 15 April, the head of the muslim community of Georgia, Mirtaghi Asadov, declared that when Ramadan begins, they will also open mosques and expect that the government will treat them with the same understanding as they have shown to the Orthodox church. Two days after this statement, Mirtaghi Asadov was summoned for questioning to the State Security Service of Georgia in connection with an attempt to “sabotage” the state." Since both Easter and Ramadan took place in the first time period (March-June 2020), discrim is coded as 0 in July-September 2020. No information on discrimination found in October-December 2020.

# Greece 
*Time period: Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 Both de jure (legal decisions see links 2) and de facto discrimination.

The Greek government, alongside the nationwide lockdown it imposed to deal with the pandemic, it also imposed movement restrictions of asylum-seekers in refugee camps in the Aegean islands in April and extended it continuously, without any virological basis, i.e. without any covid19 case having been found (2). The first covid19 case in Moria camp in Lesvos was reported in early September, 2020. (8) 
Note that the government had also put two refugee camps in the mainland (Ritsona and Malakasa camp) in lockdown, but this was after covid19 cases were detected. 

In addition, when the nationwide lockdown was lifted on May 4 2020, the government announced that the island camps will continue to be closed until May and then June 21 without offering an explanation on its decision. (1, 4, 5, 6).
''Moria camp has been under lockdown since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and residents are only allowed out of the camp during certain times of the day to see a doctor or to buy food. Only 150 people are allowed to leave the camp per hour. Since the beginning of March, all migrants who reach the island have been placed in quarantine away from residents at Moria.'' (14) 
After the first covid 19 case in Moria, Greek authorities have extended the lockdown of all structures hosting refugees and migrants until 15 September. (13)

In the October-December period, many refugee camps continue being under lockdown, however due to virological reasons, since covid19 cases were found. Some other camps however stopped being under quarantine after covid19 was under control (e.g. Malakasa camp on October 12, 2020), while other like the VIAL camp in Chios, is in quarantine due to coronavirus infections since October 14, last extended through November 4, 2020 (see 15, 16). 
However, movement is controlled - as decided by the greek gvt in November 2020 - in all camps, and the police controls entry and exit: ''The Greek Government announced the control of movement until further notice in almost all the camps. This means that If you need to leave the camp for your basic needs, such as buying groceries or going to the pharmacy, police will control your movement.'' (see (17)).

*Comments*:
 The Hungarian Helsinki Committee argues that the measures used to expel Iranian students for violating the quarantine are discriminatory, but I have not found further confirmation of this in other sources. The authorities also suspended the admissions of refugees into the transit zone due to covid-19 concerns (most migrants coming from or transiting through Iran), although Human Rights Watch argues that most of them had been at the other side of the border for more than a year. Coded as 0 since the measures apply to people outside the country. Additional note: Hungarian parliament also passed a law prohibiting transgender or intersex people to change their gender, but this is not part of emergency measures (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/21/hungary-ends-legal-recognition-transgender-and-intersex-people).

# Israel

*Comments*:
 There are numerous reports of Israel’s policies on the Gaza Strip and West Bank leave Palestinians more exposed to Covid-19, and with less access to health care. Especially, the imposed travel ban on Palestinian territory by the Israeli government has caused concern of numerous Palestinians not being able to access sufficient health care if Covid-19 starts spreading widely. However, the policies toward these territories and the people living there are not related to the Covid-19 crisis, and have been in place long before that. Furthermore, no evidence has been found that the Israeli government has imposed any other regulations that restrict any democratic freedoms more for some groups. Thus, to the extent that Israeli policies actively discriminate Palestinians or other groups democratic rights, these have been in place before the crisis and are not related to the emergency response.
Also noteworthy is that some Ultra-Orthodox representatives in Israel have argued that they are subject to discrimination from the governments Covid-19 policy as some areas where these communities live and operate have been targeted with heavy restrictions that also limit their capacity to practice their faith, but this has according to officials been entirely motivated by the significant spread of Covid-19 in these communities and their lack of measures to contain it themselves. This also seems entirely correct, and is thus not regarded as discrimination, as the Israeli policy has been to try and contain the spread in areas where it has spread most intensely with specific measures. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Kuwait 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing de facto discrimination against non-Kuwaiti nationals, despite some government action to try to redress migrant labour issues (particularly undocumented workers) and xenophobia. Some government lockdown measures were applied to neighbourhoods where many migrant workers live (there were cases of Covid-19 here so not coded), and the government has announced that as a result of the pandemic and associated economic crisis it will seek to reduce migrant labour numbers in future. This has contributed to an environment of discrimination against migrant labourers, including Kuwait MPs and journalists on state-owned media networks calling for deportation of migrants or restrictions on migrants to free up resources for nationals. Existing discrimination against migrant workers and the state’s unwillingness to hold Kuwaiti employers to account, for example over the non-payment of salaries, has resulted in a number of protests among migrant labourers, quelled by Kuwaiti security forces. This is regarded as a minor de facto discrimination, and therefore coded as 1. There are not as much reporting on this found in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods, but nothing has been found that indicates any improvements, and this is thus coded as 1 for all periods.

*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 Syrian refugees have been subject to discriminatory restrictions by several local authorities in Lebanon. In March and April, it has been reported that Syrian refugees were given significant restrictions on movement even before the entrance of the lockdown in Beirut, and that these restrictions included much harsher restrictions than those of the lockdown. Most prominently, Syrian refugees were only allowed to move outside there home four hours per day, much less than Lebanese citizens were allowed. It is unclear from the sources if this is still on-going, but as there is no indication of improvement, and no reports have been found about relaxing syrian refugees restrictions or adapting them to be the same as those for other residents, this is assumed to be on-going. This is therefore coded 3 for all periods.

# Malaysia

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and BBC report that the Malaysian government has detained migrants during Covid-19, including children, arguing that this was necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Law enforcement rounded up and arrested hundreds of migrants in Kuala Lumpur, and placed in detention camps. A Bangladeshi migrant who criticized these actions by the government on TV was also prosecuted for speaking up on the the issue. This is therefore coded as 3, major de facto discrimination. No evidence has been found that this practice has stopped, or that the situation has improved, and the more general discrimination toward migrants and refugees in Malaysia seem to be on-going. This is therefore coded 3 for all three periods.

*Comments*:
 I did not find evidence of the emergency measures discriminating "solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin". However, the measures currently in place give rise to opportunities to enhance discrimination which have already been in place prior to the pandemic.

1: On April 5, volunteers in the village of Pandacaqui, in Pampanga province stopped and detained three LGBT people outside after curfew, two of whom explained they were running an errand for their grandmother. A village official accused them of looking for illicit sex and, as punishment, publicly humiliated them by ordering them to kiss, dance and do push ups on live video broadcast on social media. 

2: There have been reports of acts of racism committed against the Chinese community in the Philippines. For example, Adamson University in Manila ordered all of its Chinese students to quarantine themselves during the outbreak regardless of their travel history in February 2020.

*Comments*:
 1) Migrants workers from Nepal were placed in detention centers and then deported after being approched by the police who said that they were going to get tested for covid-19 (detained on 12 and 13 March 2020, deported on 15 and 19 March 2020). The government responded that they were detained because of engagement in illegal and illicit activity, which Amnesty International says there is no evidence for (based on interviews and documents given to migrants). Since the government denies the measures, this is coded as major de-facto discrimination. The Doha Industrial Area, the largest migrant camp in Qatar, was placed in total lockdown after cases of covid-19 were discovered there, which is not coded since the measures may have been due to public health reasons. There are numerous reports of horrific conditions in the migrants camps (e.g. lack of access to water and poor sanitation), which were exacerbated by the pandemic but are not considered in the coding since the conditions already existed before the lockdown. 

I have not found eny evidence that the situation improved or got worse. General reporting on migrants' rights in Qatar shows that the overall situation has not changed much.

2) Since 15 June, 500 mosques were reopened, which can be considered minor de-jure discrimination since other religious establishments were not opened.

*Comments*:
 While existing discrimination against Roma likely was exacerbated due to covid-19, I have not found any de-facto or de-jure discriminatory emergency measures. Romania placed areas with a large number of Covid-19 cases under lockdown, which included some Roma communities. Such measures are not coded as discrimination because they were based on the number of Covid-19 cases. There was additional police deployment to areas with large Roma populations (Amnesty International report, p. 25), but, according to the authorities, it was due to high risk of criminality and therefore not coded.

# Saudi Arabia 
*Time period: Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 The Saudi government has taken several discriminating actions toward migrant workers as part of their emergency response. For example, during April they deported thousands of Ethiopian migrant workers during the pandemic, and as the UN reports the government argued that  "Ethiopians were vulnerable to the coronavirus and they have deported some with symptoms and many without, but no testing." Consequently, the government have deported these migrant workers not because the individuals have shown infection of Covid-19, but for being part of that group. Newspaper investigations also show that since those deportations caused international critique, Saudi Arabia has been keeping an unknown but large number of migrant workers in detention centers with horrible standards and under immediate risk of spreading both Covid-19 and other diseases. This is, according to these reports, still a part of the Saudi response to fight Covid-19, and migrant workers are kept in these centers as they are still assumed to be spreaders of the disease. Saudi Arabia has thus engaged in major discrimination during all three periods, and this is coded as 3.

*Comments*:
 Housing centers for refugees, migrant and asylum-seekers were placed under 24-hour quarantine. The residents were not allowed to leave the centers, except for getting medical care. According to the Amnesty International report, “the authorities imposed a special regime, selectively targeting government operated centres housing refugees, migrants, and asylum-seekers, placing them under a strict 24-hour mandatory quarantine and deploying the military to monitor the curfew”.  Based on information from August, there were no Covid-19 cases in the housing centers.

De-jure, the measures for housing centers applied for the duration of the state of emergency (BBC) and, after the state of emergency ended, were reintroduced from 7 May 2020, and were repealed from 15 May 2020 (Službeni glasnik RS", broj 66 and broj 74). Nevertheless, there is evidence that the restrictions on movement continued. According to Amnesty International, "On 17 May, the authorities deployed the armed forces to guard camps in Sid, arguing that this was necessary to manage the security situation and to protect citizens from petty crime and harassment, although no increase of such incidents was recorded in the town." A BBC article from 27 November says that while there are no restrictive measures de-jure, de-facto there are restrictions on movement, such as requirements to get permits to be able to leave the centers and 14-day quarantine for new arrivals.  Since I found no evidence that discrimination against refugees, migrants and asylum-seeks stopped, it is coded as major de-facto discrimination in July-September, October-December.

# Singapore 
*Time period: Q2*: 3

 
*Time period: Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 1: The situation in Singapore is that migrant workers have been the most affected by Covid-19. They live in dorms – up to 20 men in a room. The living conditions facilitated the spread of the virus. In an attempt to contain the spread of the virus, new regulations limiting the movement of these migrant workers have been mandated by the government. 

However, while these rules were introduced in relation to Covid-19, they were not added to the emergency measures legal instrument that is mentioned in the “emlaw” variable. The rules were instead added to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

Under the new additions, from 2 June 2020, employers have to 
(a)	“Ensure your workers leave the dormitory only for work: Only workers who are cleared of COVID-19, and who are residing in specified dormitories or specified blocks within a dormitory will be allowed to leave the dormitory for work, subject to their employers having the approval to re-open. Workers must return to the dormitory immediately after work.” 
(b)	“Ensure that your workers return to their dormitory immediately after work.”
(c)	The addition to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act states: 2C.  The employer must not allow, or cause to be allowed, the foreign employee who is a resident of an unregulated dormitory or a licensed dormitory to leave the dormitory unless the employer is satisfied that the foreign employee —
(a)	has permission from the Controller to do so; or
(b)	is seeking medical treatment or help in an emergency, or is required by lawful authority to evacuate the dormitory, 
and may grant or refuse consent to the foreign employee to leave the dormitory for this purpose. 

2: With the easing of the lockdown measures, Singaporeans are now allowed to leave their homes and socialise in group not exceeding five. However, foreign domestic workers are asked to 
(a)	Seek consent of their employers before leaving their homes
(b)	Inform their employers about their whereabouts 
(c)	Download a contact tracing application to facilitate contact tracing and are encouraged to refrain from going out on the weekends. 

Other people living in Singapore do not face similar restrictions in movement. These two examples show how freedom of  movement of two main groups are restricted based on their social origin.

*Comments*:
 Mandatory targeted testing and quarantine for Roma communities approved by government resolution 196/2020. Five Roma settlements were placed under quarantine by the military, despite a lower infection threshold for introducing a quarantine (1 percent) than established by government rules (10 percent). According to European Union Agency for Fundamental Human Rights, "The lockdown of localities lasted until 15th May (some of the localities were opened earlier), with the town of
Žehra being fully reopened as the last." Therefore, discrim is coded as 3 (major de-jure discrimination) only in March-June period.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been used to unfairly treat parts of the Muslim community.

1: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection. 

2: The Sri Lankan government have been prohibiting burials which are essential according to Islam. As such Muslims who have died from Covid-19 related deaths have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations. A petition against the cremation rule was accepted by the country’s Supreme court and began hearing the case on 13 July 2020. No new information was found about the hearing.

There have been multiple articles published in November suggesting that the prohibition of Muslim burials are still taking place.

*Comments*:
 The police, the army, and the Local Defense Unit (LDU) are conducting patrols in order to enforce the restrictions on movement. However, the authorities are using the enforcement of the restrictions as an excuse to crack down on the LGBTI+ community. For instance, officers of the Ugandan Police Force raided an LGBTI+ shelter on 29 March. Twenty-three residents and visitors were arbitrarily arrested and charged with engaging in a negligent act likely to spread infection of disease. The charge against the shelter residents appear contradictory to the Presidential Directive on COVID-19 that essentially requires people to stay at home, this was precisely what the 23 shelter residents were doing. By May 28, all all shelter residents were released and the High Court of Uganda awarded them damages of UGX 5,000,000. 
This is clearly discrimination based on sexual orientation, and sources indicate that the targeting of LGBTI+ people during the enforcement of covid-19 measures has not stopped. We interpret this as discrimination based on sex because in order to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, one must necessarily account for the individual's sex. Based on this, this variable is coded 3 for all periods.
