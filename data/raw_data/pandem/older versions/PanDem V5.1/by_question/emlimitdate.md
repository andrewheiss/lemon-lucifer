 The initially declared end date was June 17. Within the legal instrument, there's a possibility to extend the period of Biosecurity Emergency indefinetly, but only for three months at a time. Already on 14th of May it was declared that the measures will be in place for another 3 months, thus ending on the 17th of September. On September 3, it was declared that it is extended to December 17.

*Comments*:
 In the initial announcement, all measures taken within the Covid-19 Law was due to end at 13th of April. Many measures were extended, or parts of their content have been extended (more freedom of movement, but not full freedom for example). The Covid-19 Law had an initial end date in itself as well, which was at 2020-12-31. However, by the amendment on September 26, the end date was changed to 2021-06-30. It also added a clause that makes it possible to extend it to 2021-12-31. The end date as of now is still 2021-06-30 however, and therefore coded for these periods. Since the end date in the Mar-Jun period was still 2020-12-31, this is the date coded here, but as the end date changed in September, the current end date is coded for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period is given.

 There have been different time limits for different measures, and extensions of some of them, but the legal instrument under which these measures are taken has a sunset clause on 31 of March 2021, and this is therefore the date coded here.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Comments*:
 State of emergency was initially declared for 15 days. On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. After the new law, all measures and the state of emergency had a 45-day limit, and were being renewed. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on October 3 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. 
However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on November 15, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. The government according to media sources (see 1, 2) are seeking to prolong the existing measures until December 14, 2020, but it has not been yet validated.

July-September, October-December:  Initially Ordinance No 322 was declared until 15 July (Art.4), but since then was subsequently amended several times where some amendments do not mention an explicit time limit. Since the legal instrument that the measures are based on has a time limit until 1 January 2021  (Article 45 (3)  on "Temporary measures to be taken until January 1, 2021" of the Law of Georgia on Public Health), emlimitdate is coded as 1 January 2021.

*Comments*:
 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July. However, there are reports from August & September which state that "[...] we are still required under the Imposition of Restrictions Act 2020 [...]" and I have also not found evidence of it lifted/expired to date.
The president has extended the restrictions for 3 months in September.

*Comments*:
 Note: the emergency measures taken under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 have had different time limits that have in many cases been extended, but the amendment itself which grants the extraordinary powers to the Health Minister initially had a sunset clause at November 9. However, the sunset clause was debated on October 22, after which it was extended to June 9 2021. Therefore, the end date was 2020-11-09 for the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep period, but is 2021-06-09 for the Oct-Dec period.

*Comments*:
 The initial end date for the state of emergency was March 26, as the maximum amount of days the government is allowed to declare a state of emergency before they need to renew it is 7 days. This SOE was extended multiple times, and the final extension in the Mar-Jun period was set to July 2, which is therefore the date recorded in that period. On July 21 a new temporary law regulating SOE's was introduced that gives the government extended powers during it, as well as a right to declare it for longer time periods (see comments and sources under emleglimit for more information). The last end date set for the SOE in the Jul-Sep period was therefore November 6.  In October, the SOE was extended from this date to January 3 2021, and is therefore the date recorded for this period.

*Comments*:
 The Decree 2020-351 of March 23 2020 which declared a state of emergency, did not include a limit date, it only mentioned that this measure may be renewed if necessary. 
In some of the later Communiques by the Council of Ministers, a limit date and extension fo the state of emergency is mentioned, but it hasn't been found for all. 

e.g. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 04-29-2020: ''The Council adopted a decree extending the state of emergency. This decree, which is part of the implementation of the national response plan to the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, extends the state of emergency declared on March 23, 2020 throughout the national territory, for a new period from May 1 to May 15, 2020.'' 

In the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 09-30-2020 it is mentioned that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020, to continue the strategy of targeted screening and to protect patients. vulnerable and exposed people.''

The final extension in the Mar-Jun period was made for four weeks, setting the end date at July 5, and this is therefore the end date recorded for this period. On August 26, the Lebanese government made a longer extension, setting the end date to December 31. This still acts as the end date for the state of emergency, and this end date is therefore recorded for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods.

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (8). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (9). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (5). On 29 October, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months until 29 April 2021 (6). This also aligns with the initial decree being for 6 months.

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1).

''Le décret instituant l’état d’urgence peut par une disposition expresse, conférer à l’autorité administrative compétente le pouvoir de prononcer l’internement administratif des personnes dont l’activité présente un danger pour la sécurité publique. Cette mesure peut être prononcée pour une durée maximum d’un (1) mois, renouvelable une seule fois pour une période égale.''

 The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin.

According to Democracy Reporting, "The emergency situation does not have a statutory time limit and it continues today [the report is from July 2020]." Although the states of emergency had a time limit, emlimitdate is not coded in all periods because emergency situation applied since 12 March and has not ended at the time of coding.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures (such as 1 August 2020, 1 September 2020), with some measures until 31 December 2020. Some measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister's COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. " There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found).
