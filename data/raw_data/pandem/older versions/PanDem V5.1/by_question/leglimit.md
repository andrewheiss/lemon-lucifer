Inter-Ministerial Committee of Civil Emergencies (KNEC) (Komiteti Ndërministror i Emergjencave Civile (KNEC)) was in charge of coordinating covid-19 emergency response for the duration of the state of natural disaster (point 3 of decision 243 on the declaration of the state of natural disaster from 24 March 2020).

July-September, October-December: no limitations on the lawmaking role of the legislature found.

*Comments*:
 In March, the U.S. Library of Congress reported that the Chairman of the National Assembly had postponed all sessions and activities as a preventive measure against Covid-19. But on 22 April 2020, Aljazeera reported that the National Assembly passed a new law to criminalize fake news in a fairly empty sitting due to social distancing measures. In addition, the IDEA data on legislatures says that the Algerian National Assembly has normal procedure in April. However, the legislature is still not entirely suspended, given that any laws passed while the legislature was temporarily suspended must be retroactively agreed to, but severe restrictions on who can attend and take the floor in the legislature.

 The Constitution (Article 237) establishes that, while the state of emergency is in force, no amendment to the constitution can be made, but the president can rule by decree on covid-19 matters, as allowed by the Law nº 17/91, Article 20. The president continued to rule by decree during the state of calamity, since according to the Law nº 14/20 (Article 11) "The holder of the Executive Branch is responsible for: [...] c) declaring the situation of catastrophe or public calamity; d) Adopt, in the case provided for in the preceding paragraph, measures aimed at restoring normality; [...] h) To assume the direction of operations in the event of catastrophe or public calamity".

 When a Biosecurity Emergency is in place, the  "Biosecurity Act provides that emergency requirements determined by the Health Minister under subsection 477(1) are not subject to disallowance by the Parliament." (quote from https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Scrutiny_of_Delegated_Legislation/Scrutiny_of_COVID-19_instruments).
However, these powers given to the Health Minister are fairly narrow and focused on health-related measures. This is therefore coded as 2 - the Health Minister has the right to rule by decree on narrowly Covid-19 related issues.
The Biosecurity Emergency has been extended, and is currently set to end at December 17, and this is thus coded 2 for both periods.

The debate in plenary on Thursday March 26 was therefore reserved for group leaders, accompanied by one member from each group. The regional parliaments followed different procedures but also held elections, although with social distancing measures.

There are social disctancing and remote voting measures in place in the House of Representatives. Plenary sessions continue being held.

According to Democracy Reporting (p.6), the main authority during the state of emergency was "government via decrees (Parliament’s activities suspended during the state of emergency)."

July-September, October-December: on 13 May, the legislature passed amendments to the Law on Health which introduced “extraordinary epidemiological circumstance” (declared on 14 May by the government). According to Democracy Reporting (p.12), "after the state of emergency expired on 13 May 2020, Parliament returned to work."

*Comments*:
 On Monday 16 March, Burkina Faso suspended all parliamentary plenary sessions until April 1. General Committees of under 50 people will continue to meet. All guided visits in parliament are suspended.'' 

''Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have all declared a state of health emergency. This means that governments are allowed to rule by decree or adopt administrative measures with the objective of reducing the spread of COVID-19. During a state of emergency or health emergency governments can adopt measures that temporarily limit individual freedoms, such as freedom of movement (DW 02/04/2020). 

Although the government had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the covid19 response, during the Council of Ministers on April 16 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill on enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see (4, 5, 6)). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law. The ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after consulting the Constitutional Council. They come into force as soon as they are published, but become null and void if the ratification bill is not submitted to the National Assembly before the date set by the enabling law. At the end of the period mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the ordinances can only be modified by law in those of their provisions which are in the legislative domain."
The bill on the enabling law providing the government with the legal basis to take urgent covid19 actions within three months was voted on May 5 by the National Assembly (see 6). There was no evidence found on whether the law was extended after the 3 months limit-period.

*Comments*:
 The Myanmar parliament is continuing to conduct its work, and the emergency measures has not changed or limited their law making role. For example, parliament has debated a lot of Covid-19 related measures, as well as handling proposals for new Covid-19 laws (which they must pass for it to come into effect), during may and june. This is therefore coded as 0. No evidence has been found that the parliaments lawmaking role has been affected in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period either. Noteworthy is that Myanmar held parliamentary elections on November 8, which temporarily affects the parliaments work as it shifts its members and composition, but neither before nor after the elections has there been any evidence found of limitations to their law making role due to covid-19 measures. This is therefore coded 0 for all three periods.

 The National Assembly of Cameroon held its first session of 2020 from 20 March to 18 April and resumed sittings for its second session on 10 June. Decisions regarding the emergency response to Covid-19 have come primarily through the Prime Minister's office or public health authorities, without requiring approval from the parliament. Such measures include requiring masks and closing borders, curfews, social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Some of these have been eased since 30 April.

*Comments*:
 While the Constitution authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency, requiring that the National Assembly enact public health emergency laws, the president has thus far avoided this and the government has enacted social distancing measures and other restrictions through a series of gradual announcements without reference to a specific legal instrument. The legislature continues to convene but with social distancing guidelines. On 20 May, it questioned the government's response to the pandemic, citing poor performance despite its emergency measures. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled on 05 June that it would be unconstitutional for the president and parliamentary terms to be extended due to the pandemic. Elections scheduled for December 2020 and May 2020, respectively should continue as planned.

''On 5 June 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic (CAR) rejected as unconstitutional a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the extension of the duration of presidential and parliamentary terms in the case of 'force majeure'. The proposed amendment emerged in a context of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic causing concerns over the timely organisation of presidential and legislative elections in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.''

 The president may take measures by ordinance during the emergency situation, and the National Assembly cannot be dissolved, but Chad has been postponing its parliamentary elections since 2015, and are now delayed again because of the coronavirus for 2021. The National Assembly however has approved the extensions of the state of emergency.

''at the National Assembly, "the offices of the members of the bureau, the commissions and the general secretariat must reduce the presence of staff in the offices to the necessary". But "the work in committee continues with the strict observation of barrier gestures and the systematic disinfection of meeting rooms", ensures the Monitoring Committee.''

Procedural change, Parliamentary oversight: oral questions and interellations continue, Plenary: proxy vote (through a reform passed on May 22 allowing proxy voting), reduced staff on site (InterPares).

 Article 7 of the emergency law states 'The people governments at the county level shall be responsible for responding to emergencies which occur within their own administrative areas; where two or more administrative areas are involved in an emergency, the people government at the next higher level, which the people governments of the said administrative areas are subordinate to, shall assume responsibility, or the people governments at the next higher level of the respective people governments of the said administrative areas shall jointly assume responsibility. Where the people government at the county level at the place where an emergency occurs is unable to eliminate or keep under effective control the serious social harm caused by the emergency, it shall, in a timely manner, report the matter to the people government at a higher level, which shall take timely measures and exercise unified leadership in handling the emergency.'

 The Civil Protections Headquarters was given the power to decide on emergency measures related to covid-19. The parliament limited its meetings and adopted measures for working during the pandemic (e.g. remote meetings, social distancing, sanitation, etc.) and it voted to dissolve itself on 18 May 2020, in preparation for elections on 5 July 2020. The first sitting of the new parliament took place on 21 July 2020. 

According to OSCE report (p.71), the measures were addressed retroactively by the parliament: "accelerated legislative processes have also been used to adopt legislative acts in order to retroactively provide a legal basis for government action already undertaken or being implemented" and "the Civil Protection Authority adopted quarantines measures and movement restrictions based on legislation that says such measures should be adopted by the Minister of Health. The situation was retroactively addressed by Parliament, potentially contravening the general prohibition of retroactive effect."

 The Senate and National Assembly of the DRC decided on March 18 to suspend all sessions for the month of March due to COVID-19 (until April 5).The regular session opened on 16 March, but all legislative activities were suspended from 18 March to 05 April due to Covid-19. Since then, the legislature has resumed with special rules of procedure for social distancing. While the legislature must approve the state of emergency, this gives powers to the executive to rule by decree "the measures necessary to respond to the situation" using ordinances deliberated through the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the National Assembly, however, may challenge the government and consider motions of no confidence or censorship.
The state of emergency was lifted on July 22.

*Comments*:
 The legislative is still working, but the executive had the autonomy to rule by decree during the state of emergency. The Law on Civil Protection, Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, art. 25 says that "In the event that a State of Emergency is decreed, the President of the Republic will be the highest authority in the execution of contingency plans for civil protection, as well as disaster mitigation". The legislative decree nº 593, that declared a state of emergency, says that "The Ministry of Health shall perform all the necessary actions, in order to comply with the Plan for Prevention, Containment and Response to the covid-19 pandemic and provide the essential public services to prevent its spread among the inhabitants of the Republic". The vague formulation of the law gives the executive the right to rule by decree on issues that may exceed covid-19 related issues. However, the law also defines that the executive needs legislative approval for measures that impose limits to constitutional rights.

 According to the Emergency Powers Act, all decrees must be approved or repealed by parliament within a week of its declaration, and in case of repeal it will be immediately terminated. The Act states that:"The Decree shall be immediately submitted to the Parliament. The Parliament shall decide whether the Decree is to apply as such or whether it is to be repealed in full or in part and whether it is to remain in force for the period provided or for a shorter period.” The parliament thus retained its law making role and was not circumvented by the state of emergency. After the SOE ended, the parliaments role has also been preserved, and this is therefore coded as 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The executive is has the power to make fast-track laws and decisions on Covid19 related matters (using art 44 of Constitution), but not to rule by decree, as these fast-track laws need parliamentary approval on a later stage.
 The Legislature continues working as normal, but with fewer sessions and fewer MPs present. The parliamentary oversight is still in place and functioning. 
''Plenary: Reduced quorum, Committee: Limited to urgent matters, Voting mechanism: Ballot paper, Staff: Non-essential are working remotely.
Used procedure of 'organized debate'. Committees can conduct meetings physically or remotely.'' (1, 2)
Also, the Greek Parliament decided to only vote on one draft bill per week, with priority given to bills related to the management of the coronavirus outbreak. (3)

In the second wave of covid19, in October - November 2020, the government implemented a few stricter measures with regards to rules and measures in the Parliament building (see 8, 9), but these do not affect parlimantary oversight or legislative work.
However, the government has been criticized  of eroding parliamentary scrutiny in the midst of the pandemic (6), mainly for having launched several non-covid19 related laws, many of which quite important (environmental bills, education), with fast-track processes (using the same legal instrument -art 44- that is being used to deal with the pandemic).

*Comments*:
 The emergency legislation put in place during the pandemic has not regarded or affected the parliaments work, and no general state of emergency or emergency legislation has been declared that allows the government to rule by decree. While some measures have been taken by the government without parliamentary approval, these emergency powers existed prior to Covid-19, and therefore no emergency measures taken in relation to Covid-19 has changed the parliaments law making role. Furthermore, the parliament has continued to work during the pandemic. This is therefore coded 0. It is worth noting that Hong Kong postponed their planned parliamentary elections in September 2020 by a year. This has however not affected the current parliaments work, and this parliament continues to sit until the next election. Furthermore, a set of pro-democracy legislators were expelled from the parliament, and others left in protest. Again, this is not in relation to Covid-19 measures, and is thus not taken into account here.

 The Iranian Parliament's law making role has not been affected by the emergency measures taken by Iran, according to the IPU. Parlamentarians have primarily worked remotely, but they have for example worked with the government to pass financial aid packages during the pandemic. And no other indications have been found that the Iranian parliament has been restricted in its power or law making role during the pandemic (beyond the already existing restrictions where several formal and informal powers can monitor and veto the parliament's actions, but this is not related to Covid-19 or the emergency measures). No information has been found indicating that Iran's parliament has been limited in any such way by emergency measures under the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods either. This is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 A lot of parliamentary work have been conducted remotely or with fewer members presents, and at times parts of the regular programme have been cancelled so that parliament only works on Covid-19 related issues. However, they have convened when necessary and they have passed the bills enabling the emergency response, and no indication is given that this response in turn has limited the parliaments lawmaking role or power in any way. Furthermore, after a first phase of only covid-19 related legislation (a phase that also coincided with the forming of the new parliament after elections early this year), the work has gone back to a more regular structure, although with some adaptions to the Covid-19 situation. Most importantly, the law making role of the Irish parliament has not been affected either by the Covid-19 situation or by the regulations that enable the measures taken toward Covid-19 passed by the parliament. This is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 The new parliament was sworn in on 16 March, and some committees and regular work was not fully up and running at the end of march, and only a certain amount of MPs were initially allowed in the Plenary at the same time due to health reasons. The Knesset did not work according to a regular programme, but rather focused its work on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is once again convening fully, however, and there's no indication that the parliaments lawmaking role was limited before or during this period due to the emergency measures (the parliament was temporarily closed for four days due to the speaker refusing to obey the regulations and initiate elections for a new speaker, but his actions were overruled by the court, a new speaker was chosen and parliamentary work resumed - this four day hiatus is not linked to any emergency measures, but was an act of the previous speaker himself that caused it).
However, on July 21 the Knesset passed the "Major Corona Law", which now underlines the governments emergency response, and in which they were given extended emergency powers during a state of emergency, as well as the right to declare it for 60 days rather than 7. Within this law, Government is also allowed to rule by decree on measures related to Covid-19 that is deemed acute and cannot be passed through parliament first. However, this law fairly strictly pertains to issues related to the emergency itself (and the powers only exist as long as the SOE is in place), and the parliament still has powers to review the passing of emergency legislation to later terminate it, as well as being able to terminate the state of emergency itself. Therefore, this is coded as 2 - the government can rule by decree on a number of Covid-19 related issues - from the point where this new law came into effect. This is therefore coded as 2 for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period.

*Comments*:
 The Italian parliament has continued its work throughout the pandemic, although at times with several changes to the regular programmes and much work being done remotely or in the plenary/committees consisting of smaller groups. The Italian government has since the state of emergency declaration issued a number of emergency measures through decree laws, which in the Italian legal system is an instrument that allows the Government to enact measures that become effective immediately, but which must be voted on by the Parliament within 60 days or the decree is terminated. Consequently, while the government has the power to present decrees which are implemented before the parliament votes on it, the parliament can terminate it as soon as it convenes to vote on the decree (Article 77, Italian Constitution). Since the Italian Parliament have continued its work throughout the pandemic (and as far as have been seen, approved all decree laws as of yet), this is regarded as not having affected their law making role. Furthermore, there's no indication that any of the emergency measures themselves have in any way affected the law making role of the parliament. This is therefore coded as 0.

 The President can rule by decree on covid19 related issues. 
Also: ''The Ivorian Constitution provides, ''when the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the execution of it international commitments are under grave and immediate threat, and that the regular operation of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by the circumstances, after officially consulting with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of [the National Assembly and the Senate], as well as the Constitutional Council. The same article of the Constitution specifies that the President may not dissolve the National Assembly during such times, and that the Parliament always has the right to meet. There does not appear to be any formal provision in Ivorian law regarding the functioning of the national legislature under emergency measures, nor does Ivorian law appear to provide for any sort of “emergency parliament” with devolved powers from the whole parliament to address crisis situations.''

''Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the National Assembly has limited all meetings to a maximum of 50 participants. Furthermore, the President of the National Assembly has requested that all members, staff, and visitors wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer available at washing stations installed at the building’s entrances and exits.''

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency under the Defence Law gives the prime minister far reaching authority and full responsibility to enact emergency measures. The parliament still meets however, and can for example question the prime minister on the actions taken under the Defense Law, although their law making role is significantly curtailed under the state of emergency. This is therefore coded as 3.
Note that the Jordanian king has elected a new Prime Minister in October, and that Jordan held parliamentary elections on November 12. This, however, does not seem seem to have any further impact on the parliaments law making role, as it stays as limited as before during the state of emergency.

 The government declared a state of emergency in certain areas that was ratified by the legislature on 24 March and extended on 14 April. The Constitution (Chapter 74, Article 5, point 1) says that the legislature has authority to ratify or repeal presidential decrees on emergency measures (“The Jogorku Kenesh shall introduce the state of emergency in cases and in accordance with procedure envisaged in the constitutional law, shall approve or repeal Presidential decrees on this matter”). The legislature ratified and, in some cases, recommended the government to make changes on emergency measures. There were also Q&A sessions where the government reported on the implementation of the emergency measures to the legislature. According to Inter Pares, the parliament followed normal procedures with limited activities due to the pandemic.

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The parliamentary Union, Reuters and two local media outlets (The New Arab and Arab News) report that the Lebanese parliament meetings were postponed March 10 for health reasons. Since then, they have convened a couple of times, the first being at April 21, and they have during these sessions performed a lot of the regular parliamentary work. The parliament has also continued to hold sessions over the summer and fall, and has for example voted on a separate state of emergency for the explosion in Beirut in August.  However, as the parliament has only held sparse sessions, the government has been given enhanced control during this time. Furthermore, most emergency measures seem to be taken by and handled by the government. This is therefore coded as 2, as the government has gained an increased capacity to rule by decree during the crisis and due to parliament not having regular sessions, but that parliament still convene and perform their work at times during the crisis means that it is neither suspended nor has let the government fully rule by decree.

*Comments*:
 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (2). On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (3,4). It immediately reinstated the parliament. Therefore - for the Mar-Jun period, we code the legislature as having been dissolved (4) because it was unable to function for part of the coding period. Media sources indicate that when legislators arrived after the prorogue decree - police escorted them from the assembly (6). 

Under the Disaster Management Act 1997 - the government has a list of specified emergency powers that are narrowly defined to the disaster itself (5).

 The Liberian constitution, article 86a states that: "...Acting pursuant thereto,  the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees contained in this Constitution and exercise such other emergency powers as may be necessary and appropriate to take care of the emergency.." However, article 87a states that:"Emergency powers do not include the power to suspend or abrogate the Constitution [or] dissolve the Legislature...". 3.3. of the Executive Law also provides the president with the right to declare curfews or quarantines, etc.
The state of emergency ended on July 21. Under the public health law § 14.2. the minister of health has extended rights to deal with the emergency. The legislature is not mentioned in the public health law.

 No limitations on the lawmaking power of the legislature found. According to IDEA, "Seimas (Parliament) of Lithuania meetings have been limited. During the quarantine, it held only one weekly ordinary sitting and urgent hearings to discuss the Government’s draft legislation related to COVID-19. Critics argued that such urgent law-making created challenges for meaningful parliamentary scrutiny, sometimes resulting in rushed approval of laws submitted by the Government, according to analysts. Greater parliamentary scrutiny of the emergency declaration would have been considered desirable according to the same sources."

*Comments*:
 The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988 activates the powers of the National Security Council Act of 2016, which gives the government and Minister of Health vast powers to rule by decree on a number of issues (see part V of the National Security Council Act of 2016). However, the parliament has convened and held sessions during the pandemic, and the government has not suspended it (although their meeting was  initially postponed due to Covid-19). This is therefore coded as 3. The situation stays the same under the extended control movement order, where the government can rule by decree on several issues, but the parliament still convenes and hold their sessions. There is no indication found that this situation has changed over the periods, or that the legal basis that lets the government rule by decree under this time has been altered. This is therefore coded 3 for all three periods.

 The government can rule by ordinance in emergency circumstances, and without parliamentry approval: Constitution, Article 50 - ''When the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the nation,.... is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures commanded by these circumstances, after consultation with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the National Assembly and of the High Council of Territorial Units as well as the Constitutional Court. The National Assembly shall meet by right and shall not be dissolved during the exercise of these exceptional powers.''

In August 18 2020 a military coup took place in Mali, leading to the resignation of the PM and President, and the dissolution of the National Assembly (see 4, 5, 6). Mali has been without a president and without a government since August 18 and the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita a few hours after his arrest by soldiers who sparked a mutiny. The country is led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita (7).

 The legislative continued to work during the state of emergency, but the executive, especially the General Health Council (collegiate body that reports directly to the president) and the Secretary of Health, issued decrees to manage the covid-19 situation. The emergency law says that "The Ministry of Health will determine all the actions that are necessary to attend the emergency" (art. 2) and, because it is vaguely formulated, it allowed the government to rule by decree on matters that exceeded covid-19 issues. The "traffic light system" does not limit the lawmaking role of the legislature.

 Based on Article 81 of the Moroccan Constitution, in extraordinary cases of necessity and emergency, the government can adopt decrees having the force of law, which are immediately binding on adoption, but require parliamentary approbation. On March 23, 2020, the parliament adopted the bills 2.20.292 / 2.20.293 establishing the state of health emergency on the national territory and empowering the government, to take all measures aimed at the containment of COVID-19.'' 
Also, some social distancing measures were taken: ''To limit the risk of infection and observe social distancing while keeping Parliament functioning, the secretaries general of both houses reduced the staff on site to a core group carrying out essential duties, while others are teleworking. A communication and follow-up cell was set up to raise staff awareness of hygiene measures to put in place in parliament.''

 Once the National Assembly approved the declaration of the state of emergency, the executive could define measures to fight the pandemic (e.g. Decree nº 12/2020). The Constitution (Article 289) states that "The declaration of a state of siege or emergency cannot affect the application of the Constitution as regards the competence, the functioning of the sovereign bodies and the rights and immunities of the respective holders or members". The Law nº 10/20, Article 34, delimits which measures the government can take during a state of public calamity.

 The National Assembly has been meeting virtually for the first time in its history, in compliance with emergency regulations that limit the number of lawmakers present in the chamber. The Assembly started its session on 24 March but had to stop because of the pandemic. It resumed on 26 May until 8 July and resumed meetings again on September 8 2020. 
Meetings are taking place with 50 members present in the chamber, there is the possibility of online video conferencing, and the Parliament has installed hand sanitizer dispensers and the wearing of masks is obligatory. Parliamentary committees of the National Council are meeting with social distancing and other measures strictly observed. 

The President declared a state of emergency according to Constitution, and the Parliament approved its extension -as required- for six months. The state of emergency ended on September 17 2020, and after that the government has been issuing covid19 regulations based on the Public and Environmental Health Act, which does not require legislative approval.

 Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take "necessary action" and "issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons" to "root out or prevent" the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary.

While the emergency measures did force parliament to not work as usual, it did not affect its lawmaking role as it continued to pass urgent Covid-19 laws during the pandemic, and are now working as normal with their law making role being sustained.Note also that the parliament was set to dissolve five weeks before electing the new parliament, which is standard practice in New Zealand, but that this has been postponed due to elections being pushed forward (the current date set is October 17). So the current parliament continues to work.

 March-June, July-September: The parliament was dissolved since February 2020 due to general elections initially scheduled for 12 April 2020. Since the dissolution of the parliament had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4. The new parliament met at the end of August but has not approved the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency. Based on the government's website, the President sent the decisions to the parliament for confirmation on 25 August. According to local media sources from 1 October, it is still unclear if the parliament approved the state of emergency.

According to IDEA, "The country has been facing challenges due to the lack of a functioning parliament. After the European Council failed to agree on the start of EU membership discussions for the country in October 2019, then Prime Minister Zoran brought the parliamentary elections forward from November to 12 April, seeking a fresh mandate. With a unanimous vote on 16 February, the Assembly was dissolved, paving the way to election and a technical unity government was formed, a recent custom to provide all parties with confidence in the election process. A month later, emergency powers were introduced as COVID-19 swept across Europe, and the election postponed by cross-party agreement. The state of emergency gives the government the ability to adopt and enforce decrees, all in the absence a parliament to provide accountability."

October-December: According to the Crisis Management Law ("Zakon za upravuvanje so krizi"), the Crisis Management Center has the authority to implement emergency measures during a state of crisis, and the government should notify the parliament about the implemented measures once a week.

 March-June: "The IPU Reports that: ""The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) introduced a number of measures which will be in place until end of April. These measures include: the number of MPs at plenary meetings and during voting is reduced to 87 from 102; plenary will take decisions only on urgent issues identified by the presidency following consultations with leaders of party groups in Parliament; some rules of procedure are temporarily suspended (deadlines, physical presence in Committee meetings with priority given to tele/video conferencing); reduced committee workload (priority given to urgent cases and bills); cancellation of international and domestic committee members travel. The Storting also established a coronavirus special committee. On 21 March, Parliament adopted the Enabling Act authorizing Government to make decisions which, according to the Constitution, must be taken in Parliament. The aim is to enable Government to take measures to limit the disruption of the normal functioning of society and mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic for the population and on the economy. The Act is valid for a month but can also be repealed by the Storting at any given time.""
Consequently, the law making role of the parliament is somewhat decreased as the government is given the right to make decisions that parliament usually needs to approve. However, as the parliament also passed an amendment on this stating that "" If at least one-third of the total number of Members does not support a regulation or parts of a regulation, the MPs in question may send a written declaration to the Storting’s Presidium. As soon as the Presidium receives such a declaration, it will notify the Government. The Corona Act obligates the King to revoke the regulations in question with immediate effect."" (https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/News-archive/Front-page-news/2019-2020/the-corona-act/)
Therefore, the parliament is still involved in urgent law making during the presence of the Corona Act, and only a third of the MPs is needed to revoke any regulation. Considering this, the law making role is regarded to not have been affected, since it both involved in some urgency law making and can revoke them. "

July-September, October-December: I found no limitations on the lawmaking power of the legislature in these time periods.

 During a state of emergency, the constitution in part allows for emergency laws (passed by parliament) and emergency regulation (decrees by the head of state). The parliament has approved three such emergency laws, and these constitute the legislation that outlines the overall emergency response. The capacity for the head of state to invoke temporary legislation, the emergency regulation, however does limit parliaments law making role to some extent. However, they are also restricted in time (expire after 28 days), can be revoked by parliament and may only be issued of the parliament cannot reasonably convene in time for passing such a regulation as an emergency law. This is therefore coded as 2.

July-September, October-December: Parliament passed a new law, Law 55/2020, regulating the state of alert on 15 May. The state by alert is not recognized by the Constitution as a state of exception and the parliament continued to oversee and amend the measures proposed by the government. According to Law 55/2020, the government adopts decision to implement measures declared by the parliament, so the executive has authority to interpret Covid-19 laws relatively widely, but not rule by decree.

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The government has made several proclamations limiting movement, enforcing social distancing rules, and curfews, and at one stage lockdown, since mid-March. These have originated from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government, and the Office of the Prime Minister, who has increasingly handled the government emergency response through the Cabinet. All of these decrees have originated from the executive, without direct vote from the legislature. The legislature ceded decree powers to the executive by inaction, since it has not intervened to require the executive to declare a state of emergency or specific legal framework for adopting Covid-19 restrictions. 
The legislature continues to meet, but less regularly and with social distancing measures.The lockdown on March 21 indeed affected the parliamentary meetings, which were held online, and the first time the Parliament convened since the partial lift of the Lockdown was on an extraordinary session on May 13 ''to allow to vote on and allow the Government to take loans meant to hasten the distribution of electricity''.

 March-June: The parliament was dissolved from 4 March until 28 April 2020.  Since the dissolution of the parliament had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4. 

On 4 March 2020, the President dissolved the parliament in preparation for 26 April parliamentary elections (later postponed to 21 June). According to Art.200 of the Constitution, the state of emergency is declared by the parliament and the parliament cannot be dissolved during the state of emergency. In case the parliament is unable to convene, the decision to declare the state of emergency is made by the President and Prime Minister. On 15 March, the state of emergency was declared by the President and the Prime Minister, which was not approved by the parliament since it was unable to convene because of a limit on public gatherings due to covid-19. The parliament did not function from 4 March until 28 April, and approved the declaration of the state of emergency (and other decrees on emergency measures; 44 decrees in total) retroactively on 28 April. On 6 May, the parliament voted to lift the state of emergency.

July-September, October-December: Art 6. of "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti"   gives the government authority to declare and implement emergency measures related to infectious diseases, so the executive can rule by decree on matters related to Covid-19.

Specific provisions and limitations on decrees made during a state of national disaster are provided within the law.

 March-June: The emergency measures does not affect the law making role of the parliament, and parliament still needs to approve measures taken by the government under the amendment.  The government can only enact regulations itself based on the amendment if it is of such urgency that it can't wait for parliamentary approval, and the parliament needs to be presented any such regulations as soon as possible and approve or deny it. Furthermore, any law making role outside of this amendment has not been affected by the emergency measures, and the parliament continues its work more or less as usual (but with some changes in terms of working remotely and only voting with a fewer set of MPs).

July-September, October-December: I have not found any emergency measures that limited the lawmaking role of the legislature.

*Comments*:
 The emergency situation allows the Federal Council to enact ordinances to mitigate the emergency that the parliament does not need to approve (but which will expire after 6 months if it does not approve it), through the emergency situation as it is regulated in the constitution (Article 185) and the Epidemics Act. Consequently, the Constitution and Empidemics Act gives the government a right to narrowly rule by decree (measures must be related to the emergency, and they expire if parliament don't approve them). 

Ordinance 1, 2 and 3 were introduced and implemented without parliamentary approval, but the Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on  25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers “only to the extent that they are required to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic.” The Federal Covid-19 Act  expires on 31 December 2022.

 The parliament was dissolved following the death of three MPs. Neither their deaths or the suspension is officially related to covid-19. Rather, the  dissolvement is because of an upcoming election. According to the constitution, the president must dissolve the legislature before elections are held (Article 90).

 On March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus, all the consequent measures taken, including the declaration of the state of emergency, had already been authorized by the National Assembly, and in addition as article 5 of the Law No. 2020-005 mentions, ''During the empowerment period, the Government shall communicate to the National Assembly, at its request, any measure taken or implemented in application of this law.'' The Law No. 2020-005 clearly lists all the domains and the specific policy areas that the Government may decide on.Art. 94 of the Constitution also clarifies that the the National Assembly may not be dissolved during the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency'.The National Assembly has also taken some social distancing measures.

The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.''

*Comments*:
 The Turkish Parliament suspended sessions for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. Turkish Parliament resumed its work on June 4. On June 26, Parliament was again shut until 30 June due to covid19 cases having been found. On July 2 Parliament reopened, and parliamentary work continued (e.g. the election of the Parliament took place between July 2 and July 12). The Turkish Parliament started its fourth legislative session on Oct. 1 with virus measures amid the coronavirus outbreak. 

The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

 The parliament performed its legislative functions with MP's working remotely in March-June. Plenary meetings were held physically and the parliament passed laws with emergency measures. According to Democracy Reporting, "The legislative branch of the government continued to function, even though several MPs fell ill with covid-19. As usual, MPs voted on laws during plenary sessions held inside the parliamentary building at 5 Hrushevskoho St. As one of the most significant changes in parliamentary activities during the quarantine, meetings (e.g. hearings) began to be held online. However, there were exceptions to this practice for hearings on high priority issues, some of which were held by MPs outdoors near the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament."

 I found no limitations on the lawmaking role of the legislature in July-September, October-December 2020; the parliament continued to pass laws with emergency measures.

 For health reasons, parliament worked remotely from 26 March to 21 April, but have resumed work although with limited number of MPs present at each time. Committees are also working, and the parliament have both amended and passed laws. The emergency measures has thus not affected the parliaments law making role, and this is coded as 0. 
There are currently temporary arrangements in place until 30 March 2021 ''to enable some MPs who have self-certified as unable to attend Westminster for medical or public health reasons related to the pandemic to participate remotely.'' 
In addition, claiming urgency, the secreterary of state has the power to make the regulations come into force immediately, but the House of Commons needs to approve them within 28 days or it expires.

 The National Emergency Act, or related emergency measures taken such as under the Stafford Act and Public Health Service Act, do not provide the executive any additional lawmaking power, nor does it limit the legislatures lawmaking role. The National Emergency Act grants the executive access to a number of emergency authority statutes that can be activated. Consequently, only already existing statues are made available, not the capacity to without the legislature create new ones.

However, the Zambia parliament adjourned sine die in reference to the Covid-19 pandemic on 18 March 2020, preventing it to conduct its lawmaking role for nearly two months before it resumed sittings on 09 June 2020.


After a legislator died from coronavirus and a spike in the cases, the Zambia parliament adjourned sine die for the second time in reference to the Covid-19 pandemic on 21 July 2020. The parliament was reopened for the Fifth session of the Twelfth National Assembly on 11 September 2020.

No further information on limitations of the lawmaking role of the legislature was found. Therefor, the oct.-dec. period is coded 0.

 According to the Civil Protection Notice, "In pursuance of the object of these regulations the Minister may (in consultation with the President, and in conformity with any directions the President may give) by orders published in the Gazette ... impose restrictions" on several areas to hinder the spread of covid-19. The legislature has adjourned a week earlier (18 March) than scheduled due to Covid-19, and after reconvening on 05 May, adjourned again until 19 May.


On 28 July 2020, the legislature adjurned business to 25 August after members of Parliament and staff had tested positive to Covid-19. On 25 August, the parliament sat for only 20 minutes to swear in a new MP. The legislature was further adjourned to 1 September.


The limits on the legislature from the Civil Protection Notice remain in place - allowing the Minister in consultation with the President - to rule by decree on Covid-19 related measures.
