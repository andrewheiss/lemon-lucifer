 No measures violating non-derogable rights found. Two sources mention troubling developments that could potentially violate non-derogable rights in the future.

1) According to OSCE report, "fake news" legislature in countries that implemented such laws (including Azerbaijan) (see melim) can be problematic since "there may well be a legitimate concern about the deliberate and malicious spread of disinformation, such criminal provisions are unlikely to comply with the principle of specificity of criminal law enshrined in Article 15 of the ICCPR and Article 7 of the ECHR due to the inherent vagueness and ambiguity of the term “false information”."

2) Human Rights Watch reports one alleged case of torture following detentions after 14 July 2020 protests, where some charges included violating Covid-19 rules. Since there is no clear link between covid-19-related allegations and torture, this is not coded.

 No, although there are allegations for violation of the right to freedom of expression - From Amnesty Intl's report on policing the pandemic:

''Following Adil’s death, protests took place during which acts of violence were committed. However, many people also peacefully demanded accountability for the death. The Human Rights League has reported at
least 10 cases in which police ordered people to remove banners calling for “Justice for Adil” in the days after his death. The banners were hung on windows or the external facades of houses. Police told the press that local police regulations prohibit the display of banners on external facades. The order to remove the banners constitutes an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction of the right to freedom of expression.''

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have not violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR. However, a draconian public order law has been drafted by the Cambodian government which could lead to non- derogable rights to be violated in the future. The proposed law would undermine a variety of freedoms. Examples include bans on wearing face masks indoors, restrictions on women’s attire in public, undermining the right to peaceful assembly.

*Comments*:
 According to the Guardian,  migrants at the Croatian border were "beaten and spray-painted with red crosses on their heads by Croatian police officers who said the treatment was the "cure against coronavirus"  in  May 2020 (The Guardian). Since then there have been ongoing allegations of "brutal beating, torture, humiliation and a case of sexual assault of men and children", which violates Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7). Coded in all time periods since I found no indication that violations have stopped.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency which was enacted in Egypt in 2017 was extended in March this year due to Covid-19. 
The Constitution does not specify certain rights that can never be subject to derogations even in the most extreme state of emergencies as required by Article 4(2) of the ICCPR, such as the protection against torture. This has enabled violations of the right to Freedom of torture.

*Comments*:
 Security forces have arbitrarily detained hundreds of people for breaking the home quarantine, even after the Supreme Court ruled it illegal to detain people solely for violating the lockdown rules and that detentions could not be constitutionally authorized via executive decree. This violates Article 15 (no conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment).
President Bukele claimed he had intelligence information that homicides were ordered by gang members inside prisons, who allegedly were "taking advantage of the fact security forces were busy helping to contain the virus outbreak" to commit crimes. He then authorized police and soldiers to “use lethal force” against gangs if they or other Salvadorans were under threat. He also ordered a prison lockdown, holding prisoners in inhumane conditions and increasing the already heightened risk of a covid-19 outbreak. This violates Article 7 (freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment).

*Comments*:
 No violations of non-derogable rights have been found in or in relation to the government response to Covid-19.It could be worth noting that Rohingyan refugees were sentenced to "three strokes of the cane" for seeking regufe in Malaysia, a physical punishment that Human Rights Watch claim constitutes torture under international human rights law. However, this sentece was never executed and subsequently revoked, and the Malaysian authorities have thus not conducted any violations of non-derogable rights in this case. Furthermore, no evidence has been found of any other instance where such rights was violated during and in relation to the pandemic.

 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home. 

4: 900 complaints of alleged torture, inhumane treatment, arrests or detention were made to the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights between 17 March 2020 and 25 July 2020. 

5: 5: President Duterte gave orders to the police, military and local officials on 1 April 2020 saying ‘My orders are to the police and military, also the barangay, that if there is trouble or the situation arises that people fight and your lives are on the line, shoot them dead. Do you understand? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I’ll send you to the grave.’

However, the congolese government were refusing medical evacuation to the Congolese opponent Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko, 73, sentenced in 2018 to twenty years in prison.  “The Congolese authorities must, as a matter of urgency, release General Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko, whose health is in danger, while cases of Covid-19 contamination have been reported to the Brazzaville remand center, where he has been arbitrarily detained for four years, ” Amnesty International said in a statement.
He was eventually flown to turkish hospital for treatment.

*Comments*:
 Saudi Arabia has both deported migrant workers and put large numbers of them in detention centers since April as part of their Covid-19 response, arguing that they as a group spread the disease. The treatment these people are subject to in the detention centers are clearly inhuman and cruel (a violation of a non-derogable right), and they have not been given trials or any right to appeal, possibly also violating their right as a person before the law (another non-derogable right). This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

*Comments*:
 The Sri Lankan government have been prohibiting burials which are essential according to Islam. As such Muslims who have died from Covid-19 related deaths have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations.

There have been multiple articles published in November suggesting that the prohibition of Muslim burials are still taking place.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have not de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR. Although certain parts of the population such as prison inmates and migrant workers, are suffering more from the pandemic, this is not as a result of the emergency measures (but perhaps a result of lack of certain measures to protect vulnerable groups), and is therefore not included in this score.

*Comments*:
 The Venezuelan government has containment centres where people who arrive in the country must stay in quarantine. Dozens of thousands of people who had moved to neighbouring countries due to the Venezuelan crisis were forced to return, since they could no longer work to support themselves with the pandemic. They were considered “biological weapons” when they arrived and had to go through these centres, under the custody of the military/police and with unsanitary conditions. Detainees interviewed by the New York Times said they "had been crammed into rooms without beds, hot food, windows or sufficient drinking water". Some were forced to take medication for covid-19 without showing any symptoms, including hydroxychloroquine, despite the health risks. Babies were detained and there were no special provisions for them, and there is a case of a baby who died of dehydration. This disrespects Article 7 (Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment).
