*Comments*:
 There are a few police incidents against political opponents but these occurred before March 11, and were not strictly related to covid 19. 
However, ''On July 24, 2020, Algerian police arrested 44 people on the grounds of alleged homosexuality. The court found the 44 people guilty of "  homosexual relations  ", "  public contempt  " and "  endangering others by violating the quarantine measures relating to Covid-19  ". Two men were sentenced to three years in prison and a fine, and the others to one year suspended.''  (2)

In addition, ''on June 22 2020, an Algerian court sentenced to one year in prison Amira Baraoui, a gynecologist and an activist, as she is one of the main figures of the protest in Algeria. She was found guilty by the Algerian courts of six charges, including insulting the President of the Republic, inciting to violate confinement by directly exposing the life of others or their physical integrity to danger during the health crisis and offending to Islam. Amina Baraoui is also accused of publication via social networks of information that may undermine national unity and that may endanger security or public order.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 During the period Jul-Sep, there are a few incidents of police violence and abusive enforcement reported in the state of Victoria during its lockdown restrictions. Police where given extended authority, and it is reported that the use of force has been excessive in a few instances. However, no evidence of police violence or abusive enforcement has been found in any other time period, or in any other part of Australia. This is therefore coded as 1 in the period Jul-Sep, and coded 0 otherwise.

 There have been several reports on police violence in Belgium with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures during the March-June 2020 period. 

 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Adil C., 19 years old, who died on 10 April 2020 in Belgium.)'' (1, 3, 5)
''incidents of disproportionate policing of Romani people and Travellers have also cropped up in Belgium, where an armed response team evicted families, including a pregnant woman and children, from their caravans''. (2)
''The media and NGOs reported the disproportionate impact of the enforcement of lockdown measures on working class neighbourhoods, home to a large minority ethnic community.
 The Human Rights League collected allegations of abusive police practices between 18 March and 29 May. In 36% of the cases police allegedly use the force unlawfully, in 21% of the cases they uttered insults. Forty per cent of the victims were racialized people.'' (5, 7)

 There are reports of some instances of physical harassment against Rohingyans by both police and military who guard checkpoints in place due to emergency measures. However, no sources found have stated any more severe cases of violence, or that this physical harassment is widespread. While there are no reports of this is the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods, no indication has been found that the situation has improved, or that the authorities have changed their strategies and behavior. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.
Note here that the substantial violence by the military in the Rakhine state is not part of the emergency measures, and no sources have mentioned that the state or military have excused or legitimized that violence with any reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports of police violence when executing the emergency measures in Cameroon since March:
'Police in Cameroon have detained several hundred people for not wearing face masks in public…''
''state security agents have been accused of using violence in some instances to enforce this measure or have extorted money from those caught in breach of the rule.''
''A politicized national response to the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the arrest, detention and violation of rights of some aid workers, and members of opposition parties.''
''Several volunteers from the "Survie-Cameroon-Survival Initiative" project have been arrested in recent days, according to officials of the initiative, which is sponsored by Maurice Kamto.''

Although violence is ongoing in September, this is more related to the December elections and the cracking down of the opposition parties. However, the govenment is accused of using COVID19 to quell the right to assembly, as it banned demonstrations indefinitely: (1)
''On September 11, 2020, the governors of the Littoral and Centre regions banned public meetings and demonstrations indefinitely. Three days later, Territorial Administration Minister Paul Atanga Nji, in a letter to the two governors and the governor of the West region, warned that law enforcement forces would break up unauthorized demonstrations. He said that the governors should arrest anyone organizing or leading demonstrations, claiming that protests would endanger lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. On September 15, the communication minister warned political parties that protests could be considered “insurrection” and that illegal demonstrations across the country would be punished under the anti-terror law.''

“These steps are a thinly veiled attempt by the Cameroonian government to use the Covid-19 pandemic and the draconian anti-terror law as a pretext to quell the right to assemble,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.''

*Comments*:
 Days after Congo announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On March 29, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On March 30, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''On Tuesday, June 9, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

 There have been several reports on police violence in France with reference to the pandemic and the enforcement of lockdown measures. The situation is ongoing by November 2020. 

“On 28 November, police officers have been filmed beating up a Black men after catching him without a mask on the the street'' (8, 9).

''The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed the heavy policing and the recurrent unlawful use of force in urban areas in France....'' 
Moreover, in the cases documented by Amnesty International, law enforcement officials resorted to the unlawful use of force while enforcing the measures, which in some instances may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.'' (2)

Amnesty International verified 15 videos of instances of unlawful use of force and/or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March to 26 April 2020 in 15 different French cities...In none of these situations was the use of force justified by a legitimate operational objective as none of those assaulted posed any apparent threat to thephysical integrity of law enforcement officials or others.'' (2) 
 ''There are several cases of police brutality in the context of Covid-19 and to date two people from racialised groups have died at the hands of the police, in France and in Belgium. (Mohamed Gabsi, 33 years old, who died on 8 April 2020 in France.)'' (1)

 State security forces had resorted in excess use of violence to enforce the emergency measures. The state of emergency has been extended through December 16, 2020.

In May 2020, six protesters died in Guinea during clashes with the police, where crowds were protesting against road barriers set up to control traffic between the capital and the rest of the country. (1)

''A report by Amnesty Intenational accuses security forces in Guinea of taking advantage of the pretext of enforcing measures to curb against COVID-19 to escalate violence against civilians. At least seven people have died during clashes between the population and law enforcement forces. The rights group notes that a systematic crackdown against regime critics began in March.''

''On April 8, a 30-year-old woman said that a uniformed man who accused her of breaking the curfew robbed and beat her."

 There have been several incidents of police brutality involving journalists in haiti. 

'At about 11:00 a.m. on April 2, several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards, while they were investigating claims that the office was violating COVID-19 guidelines by keeping applicants in close quarters, according to news reports and Robest Dimanche, one of the journalists, who spoke with CPJ in a phone interview. Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security,” according to a complaint filed by the journalists to the public prosecutor’s office, which CPJ reviewed.'' 

''In April, a protest broke out in the capital of Haiti after the arrestation of Mr. Louko Desir after saying a speech on Radio Télé Eclair during his popular radio show called Matin Debat. From some reports, the journalist and the radio host was released from Jail hours later. According to local media like Bon Déjeuner! Radio (BDR! Live) and Radio Télé Eclair, Mr. Louko Desir who is a Journalist and the host of Matin Debat at Radio Télé Eclair were arrested after saying the Haitian Government is lying about the COVID-19 in Haiti. After Mr. Louko Desir said that there are no cases of COVID-19 in Haiti, he was arrested shortly after that speech on the radio.'' 

Also in April, ''A reporter for Radio Television Caribbean, Georges Allen was beaten and arrested by a police patrol for allegedly violating a government imposed curfew, despite the journalists showing his credentials that exempt him from the curfew regulations.'' 

The curfew is still ongoing in the October-December period, even though the state of health emergency has been lifted. 

There had also been protests and clashes with the police but these occurred in anti-government demonstrations (also against the gvt's covid19 response), but not in an effort to enforce the measures.

 There are several reports of law enforcement cracking down on protesters and pro-democracy organizations, but none of these have been found to be in relation to Covid-19 restrictions, or legitmized by them. No evidence has thus been found that any police violence has occured in relation to the Covid-19 measures, and this is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 There are several reports on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Lethal violence occurred at the hands of security forces in reaction to inmates not following the regulations and protesting on Covid-19 related issues, and Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests. This is therefore coded as 2 for the Mar-Jun period. However, no reports have been found on other such violence or abuse in enforcing covid-19 restrictions. As the incidents in prisons by all reports seem to be isolated to the first period, and not a continued practice, it is thus only coded 2 for the first period and 0 for the latter two periods. Note also that there are on-going reports of police violence in Iran, but as far as have been seen these are not connected to nor have been legitimized by the covid-19 restrictions.

*Comments*:
 There are a few isolated reports of violence from police in enforcing emergency measures during both periods, primarily in relation to using what has been regarded excessive force in response to protests of the emergency measures and/or people refusing to comply to some regulations like wearing face masks. The reports do not indicate widespread violence, and the sources are mostly local media outlets. Less evidence has been found from big media outlets on this, and HRW and Amnesty do not report any incidents of police violence. Due to the few reports of violence in both periods, this is coded as 1 for both periods.Note also that  the ongoing violence in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel is not regarded here, as this violence is not connected to the emergency measures, and Covid-19 has not been used as an excuse for such violence by the Israeli government or authorities.

 Amnesty International reports a few isolated incidents of police using excessive force in enforcing the limit on public gatherings in the Mar-Jun period, and this is therefore coded as 1. However, no reports of any incidents of police violence has been found for the Jul-Sep period, and the events in the first period seem to be isolated rather than systematic. Furthermore, there have been reports of violent clashes between police and demonstrators against new lockdown measures in many cities in Italy in late October, but these reports do not indicate any excessive or abusive force from police. This is thus coded as 0 for the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec period.

 No evidence of police violence in enforcing the covid19 measures was found. 
However, in August, there have been several days of violence where five people died but these were related to President Alassane Ouattara announcing that he will run a third presidential term. (1) 
Also, in the aftermath of the controversial presidential elections of October 31 2020, more than 50 people have been killed, and security forces are reported to have ''failed to adequately protect civilians and in at least one case used excessive force to disperse opposition-led protests, shooting dead at least two demonstrators and beating a man unconscious.''

*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 There are a series of police brutality incidents in Kenya, many with lethal outcomes. 
According to a recent investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), during the first nine weeks of the government's Covid-19 restrictions, police were responsible for killing at least 15 people. IPOA is still investigating the deaths of another 5 individuals, as well as other allegations of robbery, sexual assault, shooting, and general harassment by police while enforcing Covid-19 restrictions. (4)

Since the second wave of lockdown measures were adopted in November 2020, the police have arrested over 1,000 persons for violating bans on public gatherings and curfews. In the process, they have continued to engage in "unprofessional" conduct such as destruction of property, as well as harassment, intimidation, and violence according to a statement by 15 Kenyan civil society groups. (5) 

''Rights group Amnesty International said Kenyan police had killed at least 100 people in 2020, with 21 related to COVID infractions, such as curfew enforcement or mask violations.
At least six people were killed in the first 10 days alone, according to Human Rights Watch. President Kenyatta had cause to apologize for police excesses in one of his coronavirus addresses.'' (3)

''Enforcement of virus containment regulations turned deadly in Lessos, a small town in Kenya's Rift Valley where a witness confirmed that three people were killed during a confrontation between police and residents over the wearing of face masks.'' (June 29) (2)

''According to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), 15 people have been killed by the police (as of June 15) and 31 injured for breaching the curfew. These cases have included:
The beating of a truck driver in Nakuru on 27 March.
On 30 March, a 13 year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, was shot to death by the police as he was standing on the balcony of his parents' home in Nairobi a few minutes after curfew. In June, the IPOA announced that a police officer had been charged with his murder.
On the night of 1 June, a homeless man popularly known as Vaite was shot dead in Mathare (Nairobi) shortly after the curfew.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 The mass protests against the Lebanese government that were ongoing before the Covid-19 crisis started again March and April, and there are some reports of violent clashes between protesters and security forces, with at least one protester being killed. In the reports, this is in direct relation to Covid-19, as the quelling of the protests was motivated by them breaking the Covid-19 restrictions. This is therefore coded as 2, as there are recurring tensions between protesters and security forces which in some cases have escalated, but not a systematic use of violence to enforce emergency measures. However, no reports of any Covid-19 related law enforcement violence has been found in the second period. While there have been protests in relation to the Beirut explosion, the reporting on this makes no reference to Covid-19, and the violence occurring under these circumstances are thus not motivated by or part of the Covid-19 emergency measures. Therefore, this is only coded 2 for the Mar-Jun period.

 After the government introduced initial lockdown measures in March/April 2020, several reports surfaced on social media about police brutality in enforcing the measures. Videos showed police "making citizens roll on the ground and beating them up" (1). The assistant commissioner of police issued a directive ordering police to desist such violations. No subsequent incidents related to Covid-19 are found, although there are other occasions of police and military brutality in the country during 2020 (2).

 During the beginning weeks of the lockdown, security forces used truncheons enforcing the restrictions. On 16 April, soldiers enforcing lockdown rules entered homes and injured residents in Slipway and Crown communities. Three Liberian soldiers have been recalled after a woman was stabbed in the arm. One of them was later found guilty of assaulting the woman.

No further evidence was found that indicates that security forces, such as the civilian police or military, has engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures later on.

 Tensions heightened after a police officer allegedly beat a street vendor, accused of violating an afternoon ban on commercial activities. Images of the victim were shared on social media, sparking fury among residents of Toamasina in eastern Madagascar.''
''The police have denied perpetrating any violence and instead allege that the street vendor had returned home following a short visit to the hospital. Protestors burnt tires, blocked roads and threw stones at security forces who, in turn, fired rubber bullets. The protestors claimed that COVID-19 did not exist in the town and the state was manipulating them.''

The state of emergency was lifted on October 18 2020.

 'In other instances, security forces have at times resorted to violence against those breaking the curfew, with one video circulating on social media showing police beating, in the middle of a Nouakchott street, those who had turned out to protest against an activist's arrest.'' (1)

Another incident was found, but it hasn't been possible to verify if the information is credible, nor to find additional sources that report the incident, therefore it is not included in the coding score.
''Abass Hamadi Diallo, born in 1986, was in southern Mauritania on 28 May near the border with Senegal that at the time was observing curfew regulations imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The young man, father of six, was helping a dark man and his nephew with the transport of merchandise when a gunshot hit him fatally in the chest.'' (2)

 No evidence was found that indicates that security forces, such as the civilian police or military, has engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures. There are other police brutality incidents during this period, but none of them are related to the covid19 measures' enforcement. 

However, one of these incidents that took place, refers to two men that reported a case of assault with intent to cause body harm against members of the Namib Desert/Operation Covid-19 last Tuesday. The description of the event however does not mention any other reference to covid19 measures.

There was also one incident when a father with his son in his car turned around when he saw a police checkpoint (children were not allowed to leave the house during quarantine), so a police car followed them and shot at the car. The child was hit and seriously injured but recovered, and the police officers were detained. While reports in October and November were not identified, there is no evidence that the use of violence was discontinued.

 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments or penalities have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home.

4: A video posted on July 23, showed a police officer kicking a man's leg and pushing him to the ground before kneeling on his neck and mouth. This occured after the man was found to have been riding a motorcycle without a face mask, violating Covid-19 rules.

I have not found new cases of police violence. However since these incidents appear to be occuring frequently, I have coded this variable as 2 on all time periods.

 There have been reports of the police killing two persons, but it is not very clear whether this was to enforce lockdown measures - Rwandan police has rejected these accusations. For this reason, but also because it is only this incident reported, coding is 1 (although allegedly with lethal outcomes).

''Rwandan police shot and killed two people who attacked officers while on routine patrol. ''People should not confuse the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 with this unfortunate incident,'' the police said on Twitter.''
No more incidents were found after the March-June period.

 Police in Senegal have fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters demanding an end to coronavirus restrictions. '' (June 5, 2020)
The state of emergency was lifted on June 30 2020.

''In Senegal, where clashes between police and civilians are rare, the first night of a nationwide curfew in late March was marred by violence. Videos posted online showed police swiping at fleeing civilians with batons. Reuters could not verify the footage, but police in a statement apologised for the use of ''excessive interventions''and promised to punish officers involved.''
''Footage from Senegal surfaced last week showing policemen beating people found outside after a night curfew. In one video, officials force three young men to do squats after they were caught exercising at night. Police eventually assured that all "excessive interventions" had been punished.''

 There have been multiple instances of the police using physical violence to execute the emergency measures prior to July 2020. 

1: On June 2020, police arrested 53 people who were participating in a black lives matter protest in Colombo close to the U.S embassy. An earlier court order has disallowed protests in the general area. Video recordings showed that the police used violence while the protestors were protesting peacefully.

2: On June 2020, CCTV footage showed policemen assaulted a teenager with autisim who was unable to communicate why he was outside during the curfew.

I did not find additional information on instance of police or military violence to execute the emergency measures after July 2020.

*Comments*:
 On 2 April, President Faure Gnassingbé, Eyadéma’s son, announced a state of emergency and a curfew to go into immediate effect. The government deployed 5,000 soldiers who beat and assaulted civilians that same evening. Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. A video also emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten. The minister of security said an epileptic attack was the cause of death, but the family says he was tortured by security forces.''  (2, 3)
The nationwide curfew was lifted in June, but since August 2020 there had been a few areas in Togo where a lockdown and curfew were imposed: the towns of Sokodé, Tchamba and Adjengre, and subsequently in the prefectures concerned.

*Comments*:
 There are some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government. Stopping these demonstrations have been made with reference to Covid-19, that the demonstrations contribute to spreading the disease and therefore needs to be stopped. There is also one report by Human Rights Watch that states that there are a few reported instances where police have used excessive force when for example scattering or fining people in areas for not following Covid-19 regulations. These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and this is therefore coded as 1.
