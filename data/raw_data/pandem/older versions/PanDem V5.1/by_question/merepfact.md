*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

In addition, ''journalists are required to  report concrete facts about the impact of the disease on the country's society and economy. As for the daily state of the contagion, the authorities very quickly introduced red lines: no doctor, hospital director or local health director can announce figures related to Covid-19. Only the National Commission for Monitoring and Surveillance of the Coronavirus Epidemic, composed of scientists, can provide data on the disease. For the government, the objective is to ensure communication that is "as transparent, reliable and credible as possible". Every day at 5 p.m., at a press conference, this commission presents official statistics on the progress of the disease. However, this press conference is not really a press conference, since the spokesperson of this body simply lists the numbers of new cases, recovered patients and deaths.'' (1)
''Journalists have soon understood that the authorities took the sensitivity of health information very seriously. At the end of March, the daily El-Sawt-el-Akher published a letter from a member of parliament to the wali of Batna in which he denounced a misdiagnosis by the Algiers Pasteur Institute. According to the deputy, a patient who tested negative for Covid-19 was in fact a carrier of the virus, a situation that would have caused the disease to spread in his locality. After being summoned by the national police, two journalists and the director of this publication were placed under judicial supervision for "undermining national unity" and "distribution of a publication that could harm the national interest" ...'' (1)

Also: In a statement on July 11, the Algerian Minister of Communication accused the media of spreading falsehoods about COVID-19 and threatened jounalists with 5 years imprisonment.

Also: ''One journalist, Khaled Drareni, an editor at the Algerian publication, the Casbah Tribune, was arrested for allegedly "inciting an unarmed gathering and endangering national unity" over his critical Covid-19 coverage. In the past, Drareni had been arrested for his coverage of anti-government protests which had been staged every Friday for more than a year, before it was stopped because of Covid-19.''

*Comments*:
 There is a website with updates related on covid-19 and I found no specific cases where journalists' reporting on covid-19 were targeted. Nevertheless, the media in Azerbaijan in general is suppressed, therefore merepfact is coded as 1.  IPI reports that: "Over the last decade, Aliyev, who has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003 and won every presidential election with around 80 percent of the vote, has gradually tightened his grip over the media space and overseen the persecution of critical journalists and bloggers. Several have fled the country, while those who remain often self-censor for fear of arrest.The country has one of the highest number of journalists in jail in the region. According to IPI research, in addition to those jailed this month [April 2020], five more journalists are currently behind bars."

*Comments*:
 The Bangladeshi government introduced the Digital Security Act in 2018 and this act has been frequently used during the pandemic to stifle press freedom in the country. Under this Act, journalists can be taken to court and punished for ‘spreading rumours and carrying out anti-government activities’. 

1: According to Reporters with Borders, at least 15 journalists have been been attacked for their reporting on Covid-19. They were arrested under the 'Digital Security Act' which was passed in 2018. 

2: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has been accused of trying to prevent journalists from informing the public about the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. 

3: Among the journalists who have been arrested, one journalist, Ahmed, was arrested after writing an article criticizing the shortage of personal protective equipment for health professionals.

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Journalist Siarhei Satsuk was detained on 25 March 2020 based on corruption charges after publishing an article that challenges official covid-19 statistics figures. 
On 7 May, "the Belarusian authorities stripped two Russian media workers of their press accreditation after they reported about increasing coronavirus death rates in the country." (IPI)

Although new information was found since June 2020, still coded as 1 as media freedom in Belarus in general is restricted, and independent journalism has been further limited since the 9 August presidential elections. Numerous articles by the IPI and Reporters without Borders on increasing restrictions on press freedom suggest that media faces de-facto limitations on their reporting, which would also apply to reporting on the nature of the Covid-19 virus. For example, on 29 August 2020 the government withdrew accrediation of 17 journalists working for "Associated Press, AFP, German television network ARD, Deutsche Welle, Reuters, RFE/RL, Radio France International, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal" (IPI). Since 21 August, the government blocked more than 70 websites, including "Radio Svaboda (the Belarusian service of Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty), the site of Belsat (a TV channel run by exile journalists based in Warsaw), the Belarusian sites of The Village and Warsaw-based Euroradio, and the Belarusian version of the Russian alternative media outlet MediaZona." (Reporters without Borders).

 No explicit de-facto limitations on reporting about the nature of the Covid-19  were found. 

The media however are ''closely watched'', and have been subjected to close surveillance'', and ''pro-government reporting “guidelines” are often sent to the media after cabinet meetings.'' (1)

Also, on July 7, 2020, Benin’s media regulator, the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC), has ordered the immediate closure of all “unauthorized” online media outlets. This decision was taken based on article 252 of Law No. 2015-07 of March 20, 2015 on the Information Code in Republic of Benin, according to which ''the direct or indirect operation in the Republic of Benin for free or against payment of a website providing audiovisual communication and print media services intended for the public, is subject to the authorization of the HAAC.'' (see links 6-11). 

After the reactions that this decision provoked, the governemnt made efforts to alleviate the situation and lift the decision to close unauthorized media outlets. (see 12).

*Comments*:
 A journalist was arrested and jailed for two years in May 2020 for reporting on a person having died of Covid-19, under Article 505 of the Penal Code  stating that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public". This legislation evidently puts de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19. Myanmar has also closed down over 200 websites in response to the crisis, many of which were media outlets, claiming that these sites spread "fake news”, a ban that has largely continued throughout the year. Furthermore, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders in place during the fall of 2020, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both covid-19 and non covid-19-related news. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

 The final category of African COVID profiles are those countries—Tanzania, Burundi, and Eritrea—that are not actively testing or reporting on their coronavirus cases. As a result, it is very difficult to say with any confidence how seriously the pandemic is affecting these countries.'' (1)
''Burundi’s government is failing to communicate fact-based information on the Covid-19 pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.'' (2)

There are widepread reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on covid19 related matters.
''A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients “presenting all the symptoms of coronavirus” last week.''

 The media and journalists in CAR face many challenges: ''As the CAR struggles to emerge from the violence of a civil war in which newspaper offices were ransacked and radio stations were destroyed, attacks on the media continue, journalists are still caught between the various warring parties and still in danger, and impunity for crimes of violence against them is total.'' (RSF)

*Comments*:
 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist charges on defamation and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

''On 26 March, journalist for state broadcaster Télé Tchad Aly Mahamat Bello, his cameraman Abakar Mahamad Seid and their driver were assaulted and then detained by the Chad Police Mobile Intervention Unit (GMIP) in the capital, N’Djamena, while reporting on government Covid-19 enforcement measures (coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings). The Union of Chadian Journalists said the three were interrogated for three hours before being released.''

In addition, Chad's High Authority for Media and Broadcasting (HAMA) asked in September and October 2020 many independent media outlets to comply with a provision of a law - the 2018 press law - that requires from media editors and publishers to at least have a postgraduate degree in journalism. The HAMA already closed 12 publications – a quarter of the Chad’s privately-owned print media outlets – at the start of September on the same grounds.

 Chinese politicians downplayed the severity of the virus in its early weeks prior to 11 March 2020. Police also target “rumourmongers” and censors deleted any commentary that question the official line. On 1 January 2020, the government arrested eight whistle blower doctors accused of spreading rumours about Covid-19.

Fang Bin a textile trader living in Wuhan documented the state of saturation in hospitals in a video that was uploaded on 25 January 2020. He was later arrested and his laptop confiscated for the reporting that he had done. 

Citizen journalists have been gone missing, found to have been detained and ‘formally indicted on charges of spreading false information’. According to reports, these individuals were reporting on Covid-19 – on the prevalence of the virus and the governments response.

Also: ''In the Democratic Republic of Congo, caution can border on self-censorship. “Information on the diversion of public funds for combating the coronavirus has circulated in newsrooms,” says Tshivis Tshivauadi, secretary-general of Journalist in Danger, a Congolese press-freedom NGO  and RSF partner organization. “But journalists who dare to publish this information would risk prosecution.” Congolese media law, adopted in 1996, sets out prison terms, and even capital punishment, for some press crimes.

*Comments*:
 No de facto media limitations on media reporting on covid19. However, after the July 2019 general election and New Democracy's party victory, public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA were placed under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis through a presidential decree. 

In addition, when the Greek government allocated €20 million to media outlets for them to carry “Stay at Home” public health messages, it outsourced the distribution of these funds to a private media shop company, bypassing its obligation to make public all transactions conducted by the state. After opposition parties  parliamentary watchdogs protested the lack of transparency, the government in early July, released the list containing the amounts given per media outelt, it was revealed that outlets critical of the government received less than 1 percent of the total sum, compared to pro-government outlets, and one particularly anti-government outlet was excluded entirely from the funding. (1).

Also, ''media in Greece rank among the least trusted by the public, compared to other countries in Europe.... a combination of ownership issues, drastic cuts in costs and jobs, and a peculiar relationship to political power, has produced a deeply problematic media landscape, where unbiased, dispassionate coverage is hard to find....During Covid19, the partisanship of Greek media played out even more intensely. Stories about government contracts that were handed out in less than clear circumstances were featured only in a handful of independent, alternative outlets. Scrutiny over how the government would meet the challenge of building up a public healthcare system devastated by years of cuts was likewise absent from the majority of the media. Questions over the government’s implementation of safety protocols for travelers from abroad were largely unasked...'' (1).

*Comments*:
 Journalists have faced obstacles while reporting on the coronavirus pandemic.
In April, the CPJ called on Haitian authorities to investigate an assault on a group of journalists in Port-au-Prince. CPJ reported that several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards. The journalists were there to report on claims that the office was not adhering to guidelines on social distancing.
“Journalists should be free to cover COVID-19 and local authorities’ handling of the pandemic without fear that they will be assaulted,” said CPJ Central and South America Program Coordinator Natalie Southwick. 

Also, according to RSF, ''Despite recent changes in Haiti’s media freedom laws, journalists suffer from a lack of financial resources, an absence of institutional support and difficulty in accessing information," said the Paris-based rights group, which downgraded the country's score from 62 to 83 on a scale in which 1 is considered most free.''

*Comments*:
 There are several restrictions to media in Hong Kong, especially through the National Security Law imposed on June 30. In the period Mar/Jun, the media in Hong Kong faced multiple limitations in its reporting, for example illustrated by the arrest of media owner Jimmy Lai in April. While these restrictions mainly pertained to the pro-democracy protests, it is here regarded as constituting such overall limitations that Covid-19 reporting should be affected as well. And after the implementation of the National Security Law, which criminalizes speech and press that could "interfere", "disrupt" or "undermine" the Hong Kong and Chinese government, this constitutes an even greater de facto limitation on media. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 According to IPI, the "fake news" law has increased self-censorship for journalists who are afraid of being charging with spreading false information. Moreover, "journalists could hardly find sources in the health care system or education system who were willing to talk. There is a definite fear among ordinary people from the consequences of leaking."

# India 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 1: India had officially stated that there was a change from “local transmission” to “community transmission” on 29 march 2020. However, this information was not shared in the government press release or press conference. It instead continued to publicly maintain that the country was still in the lower phase of limited local transmission. The real information was later leaked to health professionals. 20 Journalists posed ten key questions to the government on this mishandling of information and received no response.

2: The government has attempted to exercise total control over information about Covid-19. On 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, it made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

3: After this, the health ministry’s representatives told reporters that they would only take questions from Asian News International and the state TV broadcaster Doordarshan at the next days press conference. Both news outlets are well known for supporting Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

4: In May 2020, police registered cases against six journalists in the northern Himachal Pradesh state for reporting about problems faced by migrant workers amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Some reports stated that the stranded laborers did not receive adequate help from the authorities. Police said the reports were "fake" and invoked the Disaster Management Act against the journalists.

Given the general restricted nature of the media environment in India (RSF ranks India 142 out of 180 countries), we can assume that de-factor limitations on reporting about the nature of Covid-19 continue to exist even if such incidences are not widely reported.

*Comments*:
 There are no de-facto limitations on media reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus. However, there is limited access to Covid-19 related health  information. And there is evidence of policy enforcing laws against dessmination of "hoaxes" concerning Covid-19.

*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are several reports on journalists being arrested for reporting on the coronavirus, especially those who have published evidence that contradicts the governments figures about the spread of the virus and accused the Iranian government of misinformation about the Covid-19 situation in Iran. These Journalists have generally been accused of "Publishing false information about the coronavirus".  A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce. In addition, the media in Iran is severely restricted in several ways and journalists are arrested and jailed for numerous reasons, generally limiting the capacity for reporting, including on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are several reports of journalsits being arrested and detained for investigating and reporting on Covid-19, for example its prevalence and protests held in relation to emergency measures. In early April 2020, the commission suspended Reuters license and fined it 25 million IQD (US$21,000) for an April 2 article alleging that the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country was much higher than official statistics indicated. The authorities lifted the suspension on April 19. The Reuters report, published on April 2, cited three doctors involved in the testing process, a health ministry official and a senior political official as saying Iraq had thousands of confirmed COVID-19 cases, many times more than the 772 it had publicly reported at that time. In November, journalists (and bloggers) were also charged with defamation cases for investigating the number of  Covid-19 cases and deaths. There are also vaguely formulated defamation laws and similar regulation (e.g. Article 433 of Iraq’s Penal Code) that Iraqi authorities can prosecute media and individuals of breaking,  that constitutes a de facto limitation. This is therefore coded as 1.

Also, ''RSF registered few press freedom violations in Côte d’Ivoire in 2019 but police attacks on journalists, especially during demonstrations, have continued and testify to the need for more awareness training about journalists’ rights.''

Furthermore, the Jordanian media has faced additional limitations in July and August when government has cracked down on their coverage of protests against the government. While not directly related to Covid-19, it shows that media faces several limitations, and this is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

 According to Human Rights Watch, "In Kazakhstan, the authorities have used existing laws to suppress freedom of expression among activists and journalists."  Under a state of emergency, violations of the measures for controlling mass media can result in a fine or detention for up to 15 days. (Art 476 (7) of the Law on Administrative Offenses). Moreover, according to Art. 274 (4) of the Criminal Code, spreading disinformation during a state of emergency can be punishable by up to 3 years in jail (note that without a declared state of emergency, the same offenses can be punished by a fine, public works or up to 3 years in jail) . Because of existing legislation limiting media freedom, merepfact is coded as 1 in all time periods.

# Kenya 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities attempting to de-facto limit reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government preventing media access to information about the coronavirus in general.

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings.'' (1, 2)

''About 60% of these cases were related to lack of access to public information or restricted from accessing various open places to interrogate and provide objective and critical reporting on the Counties COVID-19 preparedness. In 7 cases, government officials unjustifiably denied journalists access to crucial information or interviews as part of their role of interrogating the country’s COVID-19 preparedness.'' (2)

''Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media's job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. ''Trust and obey'' has seemed to be the overriding message.'' (3)

*Comments*:
 I have not found any specific cases where media reporting on covid-19 found was limited. Nevertheless, the government has placed many limitations on media reporting in general.

According to Human Rights Watch, In Kyrgyzstan, neither independent media outlets nor lawyers have been granted permits to pass police checkpoints, interfering with their ability to do their jobs"; Kyrgyzstan has " threatened criminal sanctions or opened investigations into people for spreading “false information” about the virus, including doctors concerned about inadequate protective equipment." "in Kyrgyzstan, Human Rights Watch found that the State Committee on National Security (GKNB) either posted or distributed among media outlets photographs and personal information of at least 27 people it accused of “spreading knowingly false information” about the virus. In most cases, the agency said that the person was released after apologizing to the public, but that the agency “reminds people that spreading false information provides for criminal liability."

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on Covid-19 Laos, by making it  punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about  Covid-19 in Lebanon,  and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion introduce far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon)  This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Apart from the de-jure limitations, in Madagascar the authorities have banned radio phone-in programmes in which listeners could express their views about the pandemic and the way the government is dealing with it:
''Amnesty International calls on the authorities to stop using the measures to address COVID-19 as a pretext to sanction media outlets, opposition figures or anyone critical of the government's actions. The authorities must ensure full and effective respect for the human rights of everyone, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and media freedom.'' (1)

Another report accused Madagascan government on an act of sabotage that has silenced an opposition TV channel and to guarantee journalistic freedom:
''Publishing director and journalist at the Ny Valosoa newspaper Arphine Helisoa was arrested and put in pre-trial detention on 4 April after she was accused of criticizing the president's handling of the national response to COVID-19 in an article. She is still in detention in Antanimora prison in the country's capital Antananarivo. She was charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina.''

No evidence on whether the Madagascy authorities have stopped these practices after the state of emergency was lifted on October 18 2020.

*Comments*:
 While no reports have been found on journalists being arrested or media outlets shut down for their reporting on Covid-19, journalists have been arrested for their reporting on the governments response to it under Section 505 in the penal code (as well as other legislation) that bans statements that can cause "fear or alarm to the public". As this is vaguely formulated, it poses a de facto threat to media reporting on the nature of Covid-19 as well, and this is therefore coded as 1.
These restrictions has not eased over the summer, and journalists have continued to be  arrested for covid-19 related reporting. Both the regulation and arrests clearly constitute a limitation to the reportoting on Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: "Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 000 togrogs for a person or 5 000 000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable" (Section 5.13.1).
As "false information" is poorly defined, and this law is being enacted and journalists and media outlets face the risk of being prosecuted for "disseminating false information", this is coded as 1, a de facto limitation on reporting on Covid-19.
Since the law  is still in place, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of covid19.

''The decree enables the government to declare a "state of health emergency" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country's press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)".

In addition, on March 19, 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on April 27, 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on May 4, 2020.

 There have been multiple instances of journalists being threatened and harassed in connection with their reporting on Covid-19. 
1: Shital Sah was threatened and harassed after the broadcast of this program, on 13 May 2020. The program was on Covid-19 where he described the carelessness of the Covid-19 tracking centre set up by a hospital in Janakpur, Nepal. 

2: Reporter Badri Yadav was attacked by soldiers after taking photos near a lockdown checkpoint on 13 May 2020 in the town of Siraha.

These reported instances of violence against and attacks on journalists may result in de-facto limitation on reporting about the nature of the virus due to the fear of repercussions.

*Comments*:
 The government is not transparent about the situation and does not share the real number of cases, deaths, or tests. There were police officers by the hospitals to prevent journalists from filming or speaking with health professionals. Several burials happened during the night, so citizens wouldn't know and journalists could not report about them. Additionally, the government has blocked independent media and international press from participating in press briefings.

In a regional context marked by the fight against terrorism, visits by journalists to the most dangerous areas are still limited, and it is very hard to get information about terrorism or migration. Both Niger's authorities and certain international organizations are responsible for the restrictions on the release of information.'' (RSF)

''on March 25 2020, Kaka Touda, an independent journalist who publishes news reports on his Facebook and Twitter pages, In Niger's capital Niamey, was arrested for his social media post about a suspected Coronavirus case in a local hospital, which filed a complaint against him. The hospital said in the complaint that the March 4 social media post posed a threat to law and order.''
Also: ''Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, March 14, 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the COVID-19 pandemic.''

# North Korea 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 1: There has been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in North Korea. However, the official newspaper there has called for “for absolute obedience to state anti-coronavirus guidelines without any exception, warning that punishment will follow if the rules are violated.”

2: I have gone through covid-19 related articles listed in the official North Korean newspaper (last link in sources). While the newspaper frequently discusses the number of cases in South Korea, there is no mention of there being any cases in North Korea. There is also no article or discussion on the nature of Covid-19. 

3: Independent media and the consumption of foreign media is prohibited. The government regularly uses arrest, punishment of crimes and torture in custody and executions to maintain fear and control over the population. 

The lack of information on the nature of Covid-19 coupled with the restrictions on the consumption of foreign media within the country suggests that there are de-facto limitations on the reporting about the nature of Covid-19.

While North Korea has officially maintained that there has not been reported cases of Covid-19 within the country, experts and multiple media reports have proposed with some certainty that this is probably not the case. For example, the Associated Press reported in August 2020 that ‘North Korea is quarantining thousands of people and shipping food and other aid to a southern city locked down over coronavirus worried, officials said, as the country’s response to a suspected case reinforces doubt about its longstanding claim to be virus-free’.

The fact the local media sources have not been able to corroborate these facts may suggest de-factor limitations on reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus.

*Comments*:
 The national police commissioner has stated that spreading misinformation on Covid-19 (i.e., its nature, prevalence and the like) will be arrested and charged under Cyber Crime Act. Since what such disinformation constitutes is unclear, and it opens up for journalists being prosecuted for reporting on Covid-19 that is not in line with the governments statements. After the passing of the National Pandemic Act, PNG also with vague wording criminalized false and misleading information on the public health emergency, which clearly constitutes a limitation to reporting on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1.

 (RSF) ''Journalists pressured to censor themselves: 
The country seems pluralistic but this is just a facade. There is a score of privately-owned TV stations, a similar number of newspapers and around 40 radio stations, but all are under strong pressure to censor themselves and many are owned by government allies. Since 2014, several journalists have been threatened, forced to flee the country or summarily deported for criticizing the government or inviting opposition politicians to express their views. During the 2016 presidential election, the Internet was disconnected to prevent journalists and activists from verifying and challenging the results.''

State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about COVID-19 pandemic
''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government's figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown's economic and social consequences.''

According to IPI, "On March 19, the country’s media regulatory agency, Roskomnadzor, which has a history of censoring the independent press, demanded that more than 20 media outlets remove content it deemed “inaccurate, socially significant information” about the coronavirus from their websites. Among them was radio station Echo of Moscow, which was pressured to remove the recording and transcript of an interview with a disease expert who criticized the government’s handling of the health crisis." Moreover, "media outlets will also be fined up to €117,000 if they publish disinformation about the outbreak, raising further concerns that the broadly defined law will be used to target media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak." Based on this legislation, merepfact is coded as 1 in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 The media system is facing cernsorship: ..''censorship is ubiquitous and self-censorship is widely used to avoid running afoul of the regime. Foreign journalists are often unable to obtain the visas and accreditation they need to report in Rwanda. Despite a new media law in 2010 and efforts to develop Internet connections throughout the country, the legislation is very oppressive. An overhaul of the penal code in 2018 did not reform prison sentences for journalists convicted of insult or defamation. The spectre of the 1994 genocide is still used to brand media critical of the government as “divisionist.” In 2015, the government banned BBC radio broadcasting in the local Kinyarwanda language after a BBC TV documentary referred to the deaths that took place during the advance on Kigali in 1994 by Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels led by Paul Kagame, now Rwanda’s president. Kagame’s reelection in August 2017, after a constitutional amendment allowed him to run for a third term, means that authoritarianism and censorship are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.''

*Comments*:
 While no reports have been found on specific instances or measures of censoring or other limitations of the media reporting on Covid-19, the already existing, strong limitations on media in Saudi Arabia should constitute a significant de facto limitation on them reporting on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

 The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) was introduced enacted on 1 April 2019. This law allows members of the government to control information circulating online. The law allows every government minister to issue directives to censor, correct or block access to online content that the government deems to be the “in the public interest”. 

This law has been used to correct several posts that have been made by the public on both the prevalence and to critic the government’s response to Covid-19.

1: POFMA was invoked against a post from The Straits Times Review - an alternative online media platform. A correction direction was issued to the website’s Facebook page for its “multiple false statements”. The post had claimed that the health minister had ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic.

 According to Reporters without Borders, "Ranked 161st out of 180 countries in RSF's 2020 World Press Freedom Index, Tajikistan has fallen 45 places since 2015, above all because of massive online censorship and harassment of the few independent journalists who are still trying to work." Media reporting has been further limited due to new regulations on "false information" . According to Reporters without Borders, "Under the amendments to the Administrative Code voted by the Tajik parliament on 10 June, anyone providing  “false” or “inaccurate” information about Covid-19 in the media or on social media could be fined up to 1,160 somoni (995 euros) – nearly twice the minimum monthly wage."

 1: Authorities have been using both the Emergency Decree and Computer-Related Crime Act‚ "anti-fake news" provisions to shut down criticism from the media about the government's response to the pandemic.

In March, the government issues a list of prohibitions under the state of emergency, including vague restrictions on press freedom that can be enforced by prosecution: "Reporting or spreading of information regarding COVID-19 which is untrue and may cause public fear, as well as deliberate distortion of information which causes misunderstanding and hence affects peace and order, or good moral of people, are prohibited." 

2: On 23 March 2020 Thai authorities arrested Danai Ussama, a Thai citizen shortly after his return to Thailand from Spain. He reported on Facebook that no one on his flight was screened for Covid-19 upon landing at Phuket airport. He was charged with ““putting into a computer system false computer data in a manner that is likely to cause panic in the public”.

*Comments*:
 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charge and media outlets are being censored as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading in Turkey. While these reports are of events occurring in the previous period, this constitutes a de facto limitation in the current period as well, since it sends a clear message what happens if media outlets and journalists report news on Covid-19 that the government does not wish them to report. 

In addition, Turkey's government passed a new law censoring social media and digital networks in July, which came into effect in October 1 2020. The law considerably strengthens authorities' control over social networks and threatens the presence of Twitter and Facebook in the country if they do not obey requests to remove contentious content. The legislation means social networks with more than a million unique connections per day must have a representative in Turkey, and platforms will also have to obey Turkish court orders to remove content that's reported as offensive by either individuals or the government within 48 hours. Failure to do so could lead to fines of up to €4.3 million or restrictions on bandwidth, blocking access to the platform.

The government controls all domestic media and continues to step up its persecution of those who clandestinely report for exile media outlets. The few Internet users can only access a highly-censored version of the Internet, usually in cafes where they must first present identification."

According to Human Rights Watch, "The Turkmen government routinely retaliates against independent reporting inside the country."

Security forces have also confiscated cellphones and laptops from journalists and forced them to erase photos or videos". An OHCHR report states that they "documented eight cases of security forces, local authorities, and armed colectivos intimidating or impeding journalists from covering the health crisis, as well as six journalists and media workers arrested while reporting on COVID-19 cases". Additionally, press freedom in Venezuela was already limited before the covid-19 pandemic.

 Vietnam's media is heavily censored and follows the communist party's orders. The sources of independently reported information are bloggers and independent journalists who are aubjected to harsh forms of punishment. This would make it challenging for journalists to be critical of the government's response to the pandemic.

A new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000. 

An example of a post that warranted punishment was a person who made a post on Facebook saying Ho Chi Minh City would be locked down for 14 days from March 28. He was fined by the government who claimed that the information was false. Even though the government made a similar announcement a few days later.

These restrictions may also contribute to a climate of fear and self-censorship in reporting.

 The Zambian government has revoked a licence for one of the country's most popular TV stations after they refused to air government coronavirus-awareness adverts for free. However, this is not a limitation on how the media can report on coronavirus facts, so it does not affect the score on this variable.
