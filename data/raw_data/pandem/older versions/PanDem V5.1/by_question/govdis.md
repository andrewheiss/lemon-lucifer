*Comments*:
 Algeria has been insisting on the use of hydroxychloroquine despite WHO's decision to stop the trial:
 ''...Despite the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to suspend clinical trials, Algeria has decided to continue the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of coronavirus in June.'' (4, 5)

The government however decided to gradually abandon chloroquine treatment, and started looking for alternatives in August 2020 (1). In particular, the Algerian Ministry of Health is directed toward the use of corticosteroid therapy for covid19 patients, an approach that is approved by WHO: 

''We recommend systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19. We suggest not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with non-severe COVID-19 as the treatment brought no benefits, and could even prove harmful. Treatment should be under supervision of a clinician.'' (2)

*Comments*:
 March-June 2020: Repeated advice from the President on ways to treat covid-19 by going to the sauna, working the fields, and drinking, which is contrary to WHO statement that "there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease." (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) and reference to lockdowns as “psychosis”. The President also decided to host a military parade on 9 May despite WHO's recommendations against it (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/06/belaruss-parade-plans-defy-public-health-recommendations). Coded as 2 in March-June 2020 since information provided by the Ministry of Health is in line with WHO recommendations.

July-September 2020: no new disinformation from the government, except for a statement by Alexander Lukashenko that 97% of the population who becomes infected with covid-19 shows no symptoms, which was made in July after the announced that he had covid-19. Nevertheless, I found no evidence that his position had changed. Since the Ministry of Health continues to provide advice in line with WHO recommendations (e.g. on physical distancing), govmis is coded as 2 for both time periods (March-June and July-September).

October-December 2020:  no new disinformation from the government, except for a statement by Alexander Lukashenko that cheese is an effective treatment against covid-19. I found no evidence that his position had changed. Since the Ministry of Health continues to provide advice in line with WHO recommendations, govmis is unchanged and coded as 2 in October-December 2020.

*Comments*:
 President Bolsonaro and the Ministry of Health have consistently promoted the use of medications without scientific evidence to their efficiency to treat covid-19, such as nitazoxaide and hydroxychloroquine (even after discarted by the WHO on June 17). The promotion of hydroxychloroquine is pointed as one of the reasons why two Minister of Health, Mandetta and Teich, have left the government during the pandemic. The president has also criticized social distancing and the use of masks, and said his government will not buy a vaccine if it comes from China for political reasons. The Minister of Education, Abraham Weintraub, tweeted that covid-19 is part of a "Chinese plan for world domination". Eduardo Bolsonaro (president's son who is a member of parliament and president of the Lower Chambers's Commission on International Relations and National Security) has said that China and the Chinese Communist Party are to blame for the pandemic. However, while some members of the government are constantly spreading false information about the pandemic, the local and state governments are disseminating information in accordance with the WHO and following its recommendations.

*Comments*:
 Burundi's government, in the first phase of the pandemic (March-June), had a different approach compared to the period after June 18, when a new President, Evariste Ndayishimiye, was elected and inaugurated. The government changed course and has since admitted the existence and threat of Covid-19, with no evidence that this deviates from WHO guidelines.

Burundi's former govenrment had issued very broad, general and not very detailed guidlines on protective measures against covid19. Burundi's former President, Pierre Nkurunziza, expelled the World Health Organization’s expert team working on coronavirus in May 2020, including the WHO’s top country official, its country coronavirus coordinator, its head of communicable diseases for the country, and a laboratory expert focused on COVID-19 testing, without offering an explanation.
Further, government officials have exhibited disturbing denialism about COVID-19, and in an interview with BBC, Jean-Claude Karerwa Ndenzako, the spokesperson for the President of Burundi, mentioned that Burundi is a country ''that has signed a special pact with God.'', therefore ''immune'' to covid 19.

However, after the change in government in June, President Evariste Ndayishimiye announced that COVID-19 was ''the worst enemy of Burundi'', launched a mass screening campaign on July 6, 2020, and promised to fight the spread of the virus. (1,2,3). 
In addition, ''the health minister issued stronger guidelines, saying that people visiting patients at hospitals must “be supplied with masks and health personnel be equipped with protective masks,'', and that taxi drivers should clean seats and that passengers should wear masks.'' (4)

However, Burundi authorities prescribe Chloroquine for those tested positive for covid19 (July 20, 2020), and the Burundi health minister said that ''the medication has been effective and highly operative” (10). No information was found on whether they contiue using chloroquine after July.

*Comments*:
 In Cameroon, the President Paul Biya authorized on April 9, 2020 the local production of chloroquine for the treatment against covid19. (1,3)
''Chloroquine (Nivaquine) 500 mg or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used as a first line treatment with azithromycin 500 mg. These practices are subject to change as treatment research evolves.'' (2)

Cameroon continues the use of Hydroxichloroquine by August 2020. No evidence on whether the government stopped the usw of chloroquine in the treatment against covid after August:
''The Minister of Public Health, Dr Manaouda Malachi presented the result to the inter-Ministerial Committee in charge of evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the Government’s response strategy against the COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon chaired by the Prime Minister, Head of Government, Joseph Dion Ngute.
At the end of the committee’s meeting of Thursday, August 13, 2020 it was resolved that Cameroon will continue hydroxichloroquine as part of the treatment protocol for COVID-19 in spite of some health bodies calling for a stop. 
The Minister of Public Health however emphasised that scientific research continues and cases are being studied to assess the side effects of this medication.'' (6)

 Authorities in Chad have been using hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients since March. The government has continued using the drug despite WHO's position against it. In June, Chad received by the Kingdom of Morocco two planes with medical products and protective equipment against the coronavirus, which included 75,000 boxes of chloroquine and 15,000 boxes of Azithromycin. (6)

''The president of the Scientific Committee on Covid-19, Professor Choua, guest of the national television newspaper on Sunday April 26, recognized that patients are treated with chloroquine.'' (1,2)

''After Morocco, Algeria and Senegal, it is Chad's turn to maintain "for the moment" its protocol consisting in giving Covid-19 patients chloroquine associated with the antibiotic azithromycin. "We note that there is a lot of debate around this question, but while waiting for in-depth research with convincing results, we are continuing our protocol" , explains Professor Ali Moussa, in charge of the management of this infectious disease.'' (3)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June.

 There are multiple reports that have been emerging in from November which discuss how China state media has been 'reporting intensively' on the fact that Covid-19 did not originate in Wuhan. I haved coded 2 based on the intensity of the Chinese government's reporting on this issue'.

A former chief epidemiologist said in a briefing 'Although China was the first to report cases, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus originated in China'. Chinese scientists have also submitting a paper for publication to the Lancet. This paper claims 'Wuhan is not the place where human-to-human Sars-CoV-2 transmission first happened'. It instead suggests that the first case have originated in the 'Indian subcontinent'.

 The medical information and protective guidlines of DRC government on covid19 are similar to WHO (see 3,4,5,6), but the government has been insisting on using and producing hydroxychloroquine:

''In March President Felix Tshisekedi declared that it was "urgent" to produce chloroquine "in industrial quantities"'' (1,2).
''In June, The Democratic Republic of the Congo launched the 200mg antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine on the local market, in order to use it in the treatment of the new coronavirus, Covid-19. A laboratory has also been set up in South Kivu in the east of the country to locally produce the national needs for this drug.'' (7)
There is no info found on whether the government continues using chloroquine after June.

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June.

*Comments*:
 The information from the Kenyan government largely conforms to WHO guidelines.

While the Kenyan Ministry of Health initially approved a trial use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients and imported 379,000 tablets from India, it did not begin its trials before the WHO issued its advisory against the use of the drug. In response, the Kenyan government suspended its plans to use hydroxychloroquine (1). It has since condemned messages claiming that hydroxychloroquine is a cure (2)

Along with 12 other African countries, Kenya is now participating in the ANTICOV trials led by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), an international non-profit dedicated to finding affordable treatments for diseases (3). The trials began in September and are currently testing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms (4). Because this is a drug trial and not an endorsement by the government, we do not consider it disinformation.

*Comments*:
 The Kuwait goverment has set up a website tracking the spread of the virus in the country, and providing information on what the virus is, how it spreads and so on. In the english version of this website, all information align with WHO, and the WHO is the only source (at least explicitly stated) to the information provided on the virus.  There is thus no indication that the government distributes any disinformation on the virus based on this. Furthermore, the American Embassy in Kuwait has not made any accusations of disinformation, and  are recommending people to take part of the Kuwaiti governments information on Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 ...''health authorities have continued to use Covid-Organics, a herbal product made with Artemisia annua and launched on 20 April by the President, as a cure and prevention for the virus and is being distributed in schools and communities across the country. On 3 May, WHO published a press release welcoming innovations around the world, including traditional medicines, as part of the search for potential treatments for COVID-19, and warning about the risks of using products that have not been robustly investigated. The document specifically highlights that the use of medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua as treatment for COVID-19 should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects. The Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Kwesi Quartey, in a tweet published on 13 May informed that the Madagascar's Health Ministry had agreed to collaborate with the Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) to investigate the remedy.'' ((1), August 2020)

'The government has been distributing for free a so-called cure for the coronavirus, going against WHO guidlines.

''On 20 April, President Andry Rajoelina himself launched Covid-Organics (CVO), an “improved traditional remedy with curative and preventive properties” against the coronavirus, as he described it.
Officially developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), the remedy is an infusion derived from artemisia and other plants which remain secret. It comes in the form of a liquid or infusion, with a defined dosage....The remedy’s discovery has also pushed authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.''

When the Madagascan president ended the state of emergency on october 18, he mentioned that the country had 96% recovery rate, and partly attributed it to the efficacy of measures taken like the distribution of more than seven million doses of Covid-Organics distributed free of charge throughout the island.

It is not even equivalent to flu."; that "it would not affect Mexico"; and that "people should still go out". He shared a video on twitter of himself hugging and shaking hands of supporters, ignoring recomendations of health autorities. When asked what he was doing to protect himself from the virus, the president showed he was carrying images of religious figures to protect against diseases. While the president shared false information, the Ministry of Health and local governments are disseminate information in accordance with the WHO. Instances of government disinformation were not identified between October-December, but there is no evidence that they ceased to occur.

*Comments*:
 Most of the information provided by the Mongolian government on Covid-19 is in line with WHO, such as how it spreads, what the symptoms are, who's most at risk if catching it and some of the guidelines for how to avoid it and mitigate the spread. However, they also include a set of advice on how to avoid catching it and what to do if you contract it that is not in line with WHO. These include that avoiding Covid-19 is more likely if one "Drink warm liquids frequently and use cups with lids, Rinse mouth and throat with lukewarm water with salt, lemon and soda, Get a good night's sleep, Calm and stress free, and, Do not use elevators on floors 1-5". Furthermore, it's stated that to avoid contracting it, elderly should among other things "Eat low-salt, sugary, and low-fat foods, Drink hot, warm liquids frequently, Get a good night's sleep, and Calm, no stress, no fatigue".As these are misleading statements that are not in accordance with WHO, but are presented together with correct information, and does not counter the content of those approved guidelines and infromation, this is coded as 1.Note also, that all these quotes are taken from using google translate on the Mongolian website on Covid-19.

As this information continues to be presented in the official website, the variable is coded as 1 on all periods.

 Morocco has been insisting on the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment against covdi19 despite WHO's decision to stop the trial. On May 27, moroccan authorities decided to continue the use of the chloroquine-based treatment protocol. 
The Moroccan Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb ''also returned to the treatment protocol put in place by Morocco and the use of Chloroquine which has “proven itself”.'' (1)

“There are tests and in view of some, it has a certain effectiveness against the entry of the virus into the cell and allows very early on to reduce the viral load and contagion”, he assured. And to add, further, that chloroquine “allows to reduce the viral load from the 5th day and make the patient non-contagious” (1) (September 2020).

Government members do not wear masks in public and criticize people who self-isolate saying it is a "radical" measure. The group Anonymous published data that allegedly proves that the government has been underreporting the number of cases and deaths.

However, contrary to several other countries that import the herbal drink, Nigerian officials and the president say the drink will be subjected to strict clinical testing for verification of its effect before it's released to the public. Based on the testing decision, importing this drink is not included in the score. 

Otherwise, the government Covid-19 information is similar to that of the WHO.

*Comments*:
 North Korea has claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. However, experts find this hard to believe given the country’s proximity to China and South Korea – both countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic. There has also been one report of a North Korean who was shot while attempting to defect to China on 20 April 2020. He was transported to a hospital in Longjing, Jilin province and was later tested to positive for Covid-19. However, this case was only reported by one news outlet, the Daily NK. It is an online newspaper focusing on issues relating to North Korea and is based in South Korea.

In October 2020, North Korea warned its citizens to stay indoors over fears that 'yellow dust' which blows from China could bring Covid-19 to the country. However, there has been no link between these seasonal dust clouds and Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 Authorities in the Republic of Congo ordered and received large quantities of Covid-organics from Madagascar at the first phase of the pandemic (March-June 2020), but the covid19 government committee abandoned the experiment (in July) because of non-response to the treatment by patients:

'' ''At the height of the Coronavirus pandemic, the Republic of Congo, like several other African countries, received a large quantity of COVID-Organics from Madagascar....The committee had to temporarily stop this experiment (in July 2020). Unfortunately, with COVID-Organics, there are patients who did not respond to the treatment.'' (1)

''Asked about the controversial treatment against Covid-19 from the traditional pharmacopoeia, which was developed in Madagascar and which the Congo intends to try on its territory, Denis Sassou-Nguesso explains that lives are at stake. "We think that all the trials that have been done elsewhere and that have shown some signs of effectiveness […], we too must try them to try to save lives ".''

 Overall the information is in line with WHO recommendations (https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/) but there are some reports of state-owned media outlets spreading false information, e.g. a video aired on state-owned Rossiya 24 channel spreading conspiracy theories about Bill Gates (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEtaaNNuVCI, taken from here https://euvsdisinfo.eu/covid-19-moscows-hand-shows-signs-of-shakiness/) & a video aired on Rossiya 1 channel spreading information that covid-19 may have been manufactured by the U.S. (https://euvsdisinfo.eu/coronavirus-russian-journalists-vs-conspiracies/). I haven't found any information that these statements have been refuted, therefore govmis is coded as 1 in all time periods. There are also reports on expressing concerns over alledged underreporting of covid-19 cases.

 Senegal authorities have been using hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients since March. The government has continued using the drug as of July. It is unclear whether it is still being used by November 2020.

''Regarding the treatment of COVID-19 patients, the official said the convincing results of the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were confirmed.
Professor Moussa Seydi, head of the infectious diseases department at Fann hospital, said this combination will be continued in Senegal.
“Currently, the analysis of our data collected from 838 patients. The results that we have obtained on the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have confirmed the efficiency of this combination,” he said.'' (1)

 Reports on repeated misinformation from MD Branimir Nestorovic, a member of the the expert emergency team (stating that the virus is a joke, that it does not affect women, that Serbs have a genetic modification in blood protecting them from a virus, that we should get exposed to the virus to help create collective immunity, among others). According to local media reports, Branimir Nestorovic has not made any more controversial statements since June 2020.  Nevertheless, I haven't found any information that these statements have been refuted, therefore govmis is coded as 2 in March-June and July-September 2020. Branimir Nestorovic left the emergency team in August 2020. Because he could not longer be considered part of the government or its agents and I found no other reports on disinformation, coding is changed to 0 in October-December 2020. 

There have been reports that the authorities have underreported the number of Covid-19 cases, but it was denied by the President and also falls outside the scope of the question.

This is not in line with the information from the WHO. However, this is minor and does not appear to be inteded as misinformation.

 Senior government officials made public remarks in April 2020, blaming the Muslim community for the spread of Covid-19 in the country.

Even though there haven’t been additional reports on the government blaming the Muslims for the spread of Covid-19, there also hasn’t been any news on the Sri Lankan government correcting those statements. Sri Lanka has also been enforcing forced cremation of Covid-19 victims – a practice that is prohibited in Islam. The Sri Lankan government has claimed that this has been enforced as the burying victims of Covid-19 risks contaminating ground drinking water. However, guidelines published by the WHO (last updated in September 2020) does not mention dangers to drinking water.

 The government publishes information on covid-19 on the health ministry website (http://moh.tj/covid-19/). In March 2020, the health minister gave an interview to a state-run newspaper saying that covid-19 is less likely to spread in Tajikistan due to its hot climate. The government also held traditional Nowruz celebrations with 12,000 people in March (https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/04/23/life-carries-on-as-usual-in-tajikistan-and-turkmenistan). Coded as 1 in March-June 2020 since information on the official website is in line with WHO recommendations.  Since it was a single incident and I found no further reports on disinformation, coding is changed to 0 in July-September, October-December 2020.

*Comments*:
 The president says that Covid-19 is the devil, and says it is because of all the prayers of the citizens that Tanzania is now free of it. He also said the virus is "satanic" and therefore cannot thrive in churches. He has disparaged social distancing and mask wearing. However, the US embassy advised that all available evidence pointed to exponential growth of Covid-19 cases in several locations in Tanzania. And the WHO have not received data from Tanzania in line with the presidents claims.

The president also promises to import a tonic from Madagascar as a cure for Covid-19, while the WHO advises that this will not kill the virus.

On 22 April, the president said in a live broadcast that herbal steaming should be used as treatment. Steam inhalation cannot treat Covid-19 and is dangerous according to experts.

Since the government denies any new case or spread of Covid-19 in Tanzania, govdis is coded 3 for all periods.

 The information from the government is similar to the information from WHO. However, the government has announced accepting a consignment from the Madagascar's president through an ECOWAS program. The "Covid Organics" medicine (a herbal tonic touted as a cure for COVID-19) was then said to be handed to the ministry of health for treatment of patients. WHO advises that there is no proof of its efficiency. No information was found indicating that patients are actually being treated with "Covid Organics". Information provided by the Ministry of Health conforms to WHO guidelines and does not mention Covid Organics. Therefore, we only code disinformation as "1" in the Mar-June period when the consignment of Covid Organics was received.

 Togo has been using Chloroquine in the Covid-19 treatment and in May the national coordination team for the Covid-19 response decided to keep using it despite WHO's position against it. (1,2). 

The drug continued being used by July, i.e. after June 17th 2020 when WHO officially decided to discontinue its trials for the drug after showing no results in effectively treating the virus. 
''The Government of Togo administers chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against this pharmacologic treatment as there is no evidence that it lessens the duration or severity of COVID-19.'' (3) (4)
By October 2020, the government is still using chloroquine for treating covid19 patients (5).

*Comments*:
 The Atlantic has provides a list inaccurate statements about Covid-19 by the President (with reference to where the original statement was made), and why they are wrong. For example, the President has stated that it would disappear come warmer weather, that it would simply disappear due to a miracle ("One day it's like a miracle - it will simply disappear"), that  vaccines will be available much earlier than any other sources claim, that antimalaria medicine is an effective treatment for the virus, that injecting disinfectants could be used as a treatment against the virus, that many medical staff are using antimalaria medicine/injecting disinfectants as a way of protecting themselves against the virus, and that media outlets were overblowing fears about the virus to interfere with the election. Many of the claims have also been repeated, and when questioned, the president has defended many of them. However, government agencies and agents, most prominently the CDC, have also provided information fully in accordance with WHO, and have also contested many of  the presidents claims. It can therefore not be regarded a systematic dissemination of information about the virus from the government and its agencies as a whole, but rather a mixed and conflicting message where the president often has provided information on the virus that is not in accordance with WHO. The variable is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The information provided by the government about the disease is in acccordance with the WHO but the official numbers are not reliable. Maduro said that Colombia was intentionally infecting migrants that were returning to Venezuela. In the beginning of the pandemic, Maduro also shared on Twitter that a herbal tea was the "cure against the coronavirus". The tweet was later removed by Twitter. The president also defended the use of Interferon and Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment to covid-19, even after the WHO ruled Hydroxychloroquine ineffective. He also said scientists in Venezuela found a molecule obtained from a medicinal plant that cures covid-19, but he did not present any scientific evidence.
