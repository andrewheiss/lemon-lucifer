 Access to three online media outlets, Maghreb Emergent, Radio M and Interlignes, has been blocked in Algeria on the grounds that they have foreign funding and that they defamed the president.'' 

Also, ''journalists are required to  report concrete facts about the impact of the disease on the country's society and economy. As for the daily state of the contagion, the authorities very quickly introduced red lines: no doctor, hospital director or local health director can announce figures related to Covid-19. Only the National Commission for Monitoring and Surveillance of the Coronavirus Epidemic, composed of scientists, can provide data on the disease. For the government, the objective is to ensure communication that is "as transparent, reliable and credible as possible". Every day at 5 p.m., at a press conference, this commission presents official statistics on the progress of the disease. However, this press conference is not really a press conference, since the spokesperson of this body simply lists the numbers of new cases, recovered patients and deaths.'' (1)
''Journalists have soon understood that the authorities took the sensitivity of health information very seriously. At the end of March, the daily El-Sawt-el-Akher published a letter from a member of parliament to the wali of Batna in which he denounced a misdiagnosis by the Algiers Pasteur Institute. According to the deputy, a patient who tested negative for Covid-19 was in fact a carrier of the virus, a situation that would have caused the disease to spread in his locality. After being summoned by the national police, two journalists and the director of this publication were placed under judicial supervision for "undermining national unity" and "distribution of a publication that could harm the national interest" ...''

 Neither Reporters without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists nor International Press Institute have reported any limitations by the government or its agents on access to Covid-19 related information,  and no other indications have been found of there being any such limitations. The Australian authoroties have announced that access to information can take longer than the usual statutory frameworks due to Covid-19, and that authorities can apply for extended time periods within which they have to deliver requested information. But this is not a limitation in access to information as such, and no complaints or reports have been found that this limits media's access to covid-19 related information.

*Comments*:
 According to an IPI article from 23 April, "under the current rules, all journalists working in the field must obtain special permits from the country’s Press Council. However, journalists claim the process is difficult and skewed to favour pro-government and state-run media, rather than independent outlets. " From 21 June, new measures restricted freedom of movement only for urgent needs, such as getting medical assistance or buying food. The measures included a group of people who were excluded from the restrictions and could move freely (e.g. members of parliament). Previous quarantine measures excluded journalists and they could move freely. New measures from 21 June do not exempt journalists from the restrictions and obliged journalists to register on a certain website to be able to leave home. 

July-September: The measures were initially announced until 5 July. Since then the special measures was extended several times and ended on 31 August. I have not found any evidence that the measures have been lifted in July-September period. Moreover, a group of journalists organized a protest against the measures on 22 July. Therefore, meinf is coded as 2 for both time periods (March-June and July-September 2020). 

October-December: new quarantine measures did not impose restrictions on journalists (e.g. see a decree from 7 November where jounalists were excluded from restrictions). However, melim is coded as 2 because, according to Reporters without Borders, "ever since the epidemic reached Azerbaijan, the authorities have been trying to control reporting on its impact and obstruct those journalists trying to cover it."

 Occasional reports that authorities avoid answering journalists' questions related to the pandemic and that the opportunities to ask questions by the media are limited. Moreover, "On 7 April 2020, the government of the Federation of  Bosnia and Herzegovina issued a decision restricting access to press conferences for the media. The decision stipulates that only three media representatives can be present at press conferences given by the Crisis Management Headquarters." (OSCE report, p.54). Coded as 1 since the decision applies to one subnational entity and not the whole country. I have not managed to find any information on whether the restricted access to press conferences was lifted after 31 May 2020, so meinf is coded as 1 for all time periods (March-June, July-September, October-December 2020).

 On June 5, the government reduced the amount of information available to the public and the press and changed the time of the day when the daily covid-19 numbers were released. This only lasted for a few days, since on June 9 the Supreme Court ordered the government to release full covid-19 data again.
On March 24, President Bolsonaro signed a Provisional Measure (number 928) that suspended deadlines to provide information requsted via the Freedom of Information Law (Lei de Acesso a Informação - Law 12.527) while the pandemic lasted. The Supreme court suspended this Provisional Measure on March 30.
No evidence of limitations on access to information was found after June.

*Comments*:
 There is widespread reports that Myanmar is covering up the actual number of cases and deaths of Covid-19, and that media is not given access to any information on this beyond the government approved information. This lack of access is ongoing in both the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep period according to a report by Article19, and no evidence has been found indicating that the situation has improved. In addition, stay at home-orders in place during the fall in various townships in Myanmar have not exempted journalists, which effectively limits their capacity to investigate and access information about covid-19.  This is therefore coded as 2 for all three periods.

 The final category of African COVID profiles are those countries—Tanzania, Burundi, and Eritrea—that are not actively testing or reporting on their coronavirus cases. As a result, it is very difficult to say with any confidence how seriously the pandemic is affecting these countries.'' (1)
''Burundi’s government is failing to communicate fact-based information on the Covid-19 pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.'' (2)

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.''

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On March 27, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.''

Also: ''In a statement, the Human Rights Watch said health authorities in the country blocked journalists from entering a COVID-19 press conference, indicating that the government is trying to suppress information about the pandemic.''

 1: Monoroom.info, a Khmer-language news website based in France, became inaccessible in Cambodia on 31 March after it published several articles about the coronavirus situation there, and has remained inaccessible ever since.

2: Sovann Rithy, the director of the TVFB news site, was arrested by the Phnom Penh municipal police yesterday evening on a charge of “incitement to cause chaos and harm social security” under article 495 of the criminal code, police chief Sar Theth said.

His crime was to have reported a comment about the economic effects of the Covid-19 crisis that the prime minister made during a press conference earlier in the day. As Sovann Rithy accurately reported in a Facebook post, Hun Sen said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.”
 
The information ministry reacted by ordering the revocation of TVFB’s media license on the grounds that its editor had “selected” the prime minister’s quote.

*Comments*:
 Cameroon's Covid-19 reporting at the beginning of the pandemic was transparent; the minister of health published daily statistics on the number of infections, hospital admissions and casualties, but when the numbers grew substantially and Cameroon appeared as one of the top countries with covid19 cases in sub-saharan Africa, the government started revising its reporting strategy and access to information on the daily and actual number of new infections by switching to daily press briefings.

"It is now hard for journalists to get timely and detailed updates," said a reporter with a foreign broadcaster. "The updates now are mostly on recovery and hospitalised cases and deaths."

''Although there is no official limitation of access to Covid-19 related information, the government of Cameroon has however omitted from the public and mass media, vital information about the regional prevalence of Covid-19.''

''Media, civil society and opposition groups in Cameroon say the government there refused to provide official information about Covid-19 to media outlets and journalists perceived to be critical of it.''
''In Cameroon, the authorities are providing no information to several critical but very popular media outlets.''

(1)

Also, it is mentioned that the Central African Bloggers’ Association (ABCA) launched a site, Talato (“radar” in Sangho), with the aim of mapping the pandemic and fact-checking doubtful claims:
...the authorities are not so happy with this approach, as they cannot control it.  “They prefer a more institutional coverage, like you get on Guira FM [the radio station of the United Nations Integrated Multidimensional Stabilisation Mission in the CAR] or on the national radio station, known as the ‘mother radio’,” says one journalist who prefers not to be named. “If you want to go beyond the traditional press conference, you can have a real problem with gaining access to sources.”'' (2)

 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist and charges on defamation, and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

Also, Chad's High Authority for Media and Broadcasting (HAMA) asked in September and October 2020 many independent media outlets to comply with a provision of a law - the 2018 press law - that requires from media editors and publishers to at least have a postgraduate degree in journalism. The HAMA already closed 12 publications – a quarter of the Chad’s privately-owned print media outlets – at the start of September on the same grounds.

*Comments*:
 1: On 8 May 2020, Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang.
2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 
3: Chinese journalist was arrested on 15 May in Shanghai for commenting on the authorities\ countermeasures on Twitter.
4: 4: Two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

 1) Journalists were initially not allowed to be physically present at press conferences based on public health grounds, except for public media and two private TV stations. In the following weeks, journalists were allowed to participate in press conferences remotely through a video conference. Although the situation improved, according to an IPI report from 14 October, some outlets have been denied participation in online conferences since March. Since the report only mentions one outlet (Forum 24), meinf is coded as 1 for all time periods. 2)The Ministry of the Interior removed a video of Malá Vizita & Duše K which discussed covid-19 treatment in March.

*Comments*:
 1: Journalists who have reported on the Corona virus and accused the government of understating the situation in Egypt have been asked to leave the country.

2: Currently, more than 500 websites—many of them connected to news outlets—are blocked inside the country. 

3: In April 2020, the authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons.

4: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

5: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist with The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than the number confirmed by the government.

6: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

 Besides de-jure measure, according to RSF: "Salvadorean journalists and media outlets have also reported being unable to get information from health professionals about difficulties in the provision of protective equipment or reliable figures for confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths." The government did not allow journalists to ask questions during press conferences about the pandemic and there are also several reports of security forces interferring with journalists reporting on coronavirus. Members of the national assembly proposed a committee to investigate the official covid-19 numbers provided by the executive.

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS du 10 avril 2020 désignant les services et les personnels essentiels du secteur public, parapublic et privé d’astreinte pendant l’état d’urgence lié au COVID-19'' (1) (Decree n°00106 designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to COVID-19), does not include journalists and the media in the listed essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures.

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by November 2020.

Authorities in Gabon have extended the country's State of Health Emergency measures for 45 days from Aug. 14, 2020. A nightly 2000-0500 curfew remains in effect.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing serious government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation and still exists.

*Comments*:
 According to Art 13 (2) of the Ordinance No 181 from 23 March 2020 "On the Approval of Measures to be Implemented in connection with the Prevention of the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in Georgia", "The timeframe established by the legislation of Georgia for releasing public information and personal information shall be suspended" for the duration of the state of emergency.  It's a case of suspension of freedom of information requests where under a state of emergency the deadlines for releasing public information were suspended. If hypothetical journalists requested information from public authorities, they would not be obliged to reply in a certain time frame. Since the legislation states that the measures apply for the duration of the state of emergency (that ended on 22 May), meinf is coded as 1 only during March-June 2020 period.

*Comments*:
 Authorities in Greece, after a Greek Ministry of Health's decision on March 23, decided to deny access to health editors during briefings on COVID-19. 

''As of March 23, the Greek Ministry of Health, citing public health safety reasons, has decided to close its doors to health editors on a daily basis from Sotiris Tsiodras' spokesman and Deputy Ministers of Civil Protection and Health. In addition, the journalists were informed that they will have the opportunity to ask one - and only one, although there are three speakers -  question per week, which should be submitted in writing to the Press Office, which will read it on "air", without it ability to clarify or apply pressure in order to respond effectively.'' (1,2,3)

Also, opposition media outlets in July were excluded from a government support package in Greece: 
''Greek newspaper Documento was excluded from a €20 million advertising revenue support package organised by the government in apparent retaliation for its critical coverage and investigative reports in the Prime Minister and his inner circle. When asked why Documento had not been received funding like every other major media outlet in the country, the government spokesman replied that the government did not give funding to outlets threat spread “fake news”. (1,4,5).

*Comments*:
 There are several accusations of lack of transparency and that the government interfered with the media coverage, and Guatemalan journalists and human rights organizations published an open letter to complain about the situation. The president said: "I would like to put the media in quarantine but I cannot." The government stopped holding press conferences, limited the official information that is shared with the media and closed the institutional chat group it had with journalists. The Human Rights Ombudsman stated that "in the face of the health emergency it is vital to maintain open, direct and continuous government communication with the press in order to guarantee the population their right to be informed" and recommended that the president and the ministry of health ensure that the press has free access to information regarding the pandemic. Specific cases limitations on access to information were not identified between October-December, but there also is no evidence that they stopped.

# Haiti 
*Time period: Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 There are reports revealing a widespread problem with limitations on access to information for journalists in Haiti: 

The Haitian government initially had not granted journalists an exemption from the curfew restrictions. However, ''in a decree dated May 21, 2020, the government rectified the situation by restoring the right of press workers who "are part of the professional categories that can move freely during curfew hours, as is the case for doctors, for example.'' (therefore coding is stricter for March-June).

''Journalists have also faced obstacles while reporting on the coronavirus pandemic. In Haiti, information is not guaranteed. You have to fight to access information. It is truly difficult to get information from the government. Sometimes it will take me two to three weeks for a single piece of reporting. You call a government institution to ask for information and they tell you to ask for an appointment.Presently, we depend on what authorities tell us. They say there are 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but there is no way to verify that information. We really do not know what is happening. We are limited to whatever information they provide us.In the current context, I do not have a source that can give me any reliable information, because all of the information is in the hands of the government. There are very few people that handle this information. The rest are just rumors. Up to this point, we depend solely on government press conferences. As journalists, we always try to find a balance, to corroborate the official information. But in these circumstances, it is really difficult.'' 

Also, according to RSF, ''Despite recent changes in Haiti’s media freedom laws, journalists suffer from a lack of financial resources, an absence of institutional support and difficulty in accessing information," said the Paris-based rights group, which downgraded the country's score from 62 to 83 on a scale in which 1 is considered most free.''

 Daily press conferences are organized by Operational Group (OG) for Protection against the Coronavirus Epidemic where questions are pre-selected, certain outlets are neglected and sensitive topics avoided. The time it takes for public bodies to respond to requests (such as journalists' questions) was increased from 30 to 60 days.  Since I found no evidence that violations stopped and the press conferences are being held without physical presence of journalists, meinf is coded as 2 in all time periods.

 From 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, the made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

After this, the health ministry’s representatives told reporters that they would only take questions from Asian News International and the state TV broadcaster Doordarshan at the next days press conference. Both news outlets are well known for supporting Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

*Comments*:
 The Indonesian Government, specifically the Health Ministry, has decided not to reveal important data on COVID-19 transmitted contacts, such as recently visited locations or travel history of the suspected people, claiming that it would most likely create a widespread panic among people and to keep the order. 

The Government has not been transparent in releasing data relating to the numbers of health workers infected by COVID-19, as well as hospitals where they are working. The only announcement by the Government was only made on March 14, 2020, when the spokesperson of the Government’s COVID-19 crisis team, Achmad Yurianto, stated that several medical practitioners had been infected by the virus and that some of them had passed away.

*Comments*:
 The Iranian government have repeatedly been covering up or denying access to covid-19 related information, and undermining reporting on the Covid-19 situation in Iran. While reports mainly pertain to the first period, the reports that Iran are covering up actual number of cases and deaths, and not granting access to information on Covid-19-related information in Iran, is ongoing. For example, a newspaper was shut down by the government for it publishing an interview with a member of the Iranian Covid-19 Taskforce who spoke of Iran covering up how many cases that was actually recorded in the country. Furthermore, no evidence has been found indicating that the situation has improved in the Oct-Dec period. This is therefore coded as 2.

*Comments*:
 There are some reports on journalists being obstructed and denied access to information when trying to investigate the Covid-19 situation in Iraq. The Iraqi government also banned Reuters from Iraq for 3 months due to them reporting that the amount of infected people being much higher than the government had stated and that they had deliberately misreported the number of cases. This is coded as 1, since there is indeed obstructions to accessing Covid-19 related information, but there aren't as many such cases reported that it could be argued to be "widespread and ongoing". No indication of improvement has been found for the latter periods, and this is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports that the government attempts to prevent media access to information about the coronavirus.

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1, 2)

''About 60% of these cases were related to lack of access to public information or restricted from accessing various open places to interrogate and provide objective and critical reporting on the Counties COVID-19 preparedness. In 7 cases, government officials unjustifiably denied journalists access to crucial information or interviews as part of their role of interrogating the country’s COVID-19 preparedness.'' (2)

''Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media's job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. ''Trust and obey'' has seemed to be the overriding message.'' (3)

*Comments*:
 Indepedent media were not given accreditation during the state of emergency (declared in certain territories) and were not allowed to pass policy check points, limiting their ability to report on the government response. According to IPI: "Authorities in Kyrgyzstan have excluded 20 different independent media outlets from receiving special press passes which allow them exemption from lockdown rules, giving them instead only to state-run media." According to a report by Library of Congress, "Only a limited number of state TV crews were allowed to report from the field, and the government has become the only source of news on the pandemic."

According to Amnesty International report, health workers were silenced and received threats after speaking to the media. 

The restrictive measures for journalists applied only for the duration of the state of emergency in certain territories that ended on 10 May, while the silencing of health workers is also reported in July. Since I found no evidence that threats towards health workers have stopped, meinf is coded as 2 for all time periods.

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).In other words, only state sponsored media is allowed to report on the crisis, which de jure limits all access to information as only the government approved information is being disseminated to these media outlets.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any limitations on access to information, and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion introduce far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon) This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found on access being limited on Covid-19, but it should be noted that it is possible that the media faces such limitations in other areas.

 The government has taken no measures to protect citizens from the pandemic. President Ortega consistetly diminishes the seriousness of the situation. The government is firing medical staff who speak out about the situation and denounce the government's disregard for the health of citizens. The government is not transparent about the number of covid-19 cases, deaths, and tests. The group Anonymous published data that allegedly proves that the government has been underreporting the number of cases and deaths.

*Comments*:
 ...there has been little change in the overall environment for the media and journalists. In a regional context marked by the fight against terrorism, visits by journalists to the most dangerous areas are still limited, and it is very hard to get information about terrorism or migration. Both Niger's authorities and certain international organizations are responsible for the restrictions on the release of information.'' (RSF)

'on March 25 2020, Kaka Touda, an independent journalist who publishes news reports on his Facebook and Twitter pages, In Niger's capital Niamey, was arrested for his social media post about a suspected Coronavirus case in a local hospital, which filed a complaint against him. The hospital said in the complaint that the March 4 social media post posed a threat to law and order.''

Also: ''Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, March 14, 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the COVID-19 pandemic.''

Also: ''From the testimony of a journalist from Niger, we learn, for example, that " a large part of the population still does not believe in the existence of the disease, as the population generally gives low credit to the disease. official information and in the current context, the media are subject to restrictions […] certain media have been arrested for having invited to television sets experts deemed 'unqualified' according to the health authority ”.

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 1: There has been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in North Korea. However, the official newspaper there has called for “for absolute obedience to state anti-coronavirus guidelines without any exception, warning that punishment will follow if the rules are violated.”

2: I have gone through covid-19 related articles listed in the official North Korean newspaper (last link in sources). While the newspaper frequently discusses the number of cases in South Korea, there is no mention of there being any cases in North Korea. There is also no article or discussion on the nature of Covid-19. 

3: Independent media and the consumption of foreign media is prohibited. The government regularly uses arrest, punishment of crimes and torture in custody and executions to maintain fear and control over the population. 

4: While North Korea has officially maintained that there has not been reported cases of Covid-19 within the country, experts have proposed with some certainty that this is probably not the case. For example, the Associated Press reported in August 2020 that ‘North Korea is quarantining thousands of people and shipping food and other aid to a southern city locked down over coronavirus worried, officials said, as the country’s response to a suspected case reinforces doubt about its longstanding claim to be virus-free’.

The lack of information on the nature of Covid-19 coupled with the restrictions on the consumption of foreign media within the country suggests that media access to Covid-19 related information is heavily limited.

*Comments*:
 The Guardian reports that "The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian."
While this is indication of a serious limitation on access to information, this is also the only source found on this type of limitation (a lot of sources do quote this Guardian article however). Therefore, this is coded as 1 - there are strong accusations of limits on access to information, but only one report found of such limitations.
No reports have been found on the state of access to information on Covid-19 related information in the second period. As there is no signs of improvement, this is assumed to be on going. It is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

 President Duterte's emergency regulations are preventing independent media from covering official briefings on Covid-19 in the country. Only official media are allowed to attend the briefings. Independent media can join through video conferencing and submit their questions to the moderator before the briefing starts. This effectively bars independent media from seeking clarifications after the briefing.

*Comments*:
 According to a statement on the President's website, in the period from 31 March to 24 May, deadlines for freedom of information requests were suspended. According to "USTAWA z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczególnych rozwiązaniach związanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdziałaniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chorób zakaźnych oraz wywołanych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niektórych innych ustaw", deadlines for several administrative proceedings are suspended from 31 March. The provisions of Art. 15zzs  were repealed by Art 68, point 6 and 7, of "Ustawa z dnia 14 maja 2020 r. o zmianie niektórych ustaw w zakresie działań osłonowych w związku z rozprzestrzenianiem się wirusa SARS-CoV-2." Based on this information, I coded meinf as 1 only during March-June period.

Further information on the so called  “anti-crisis shield” act from 31 March:  According to Art. 15zzs of "USTAWA z dnia 31 marca 2020 r. o zmianie ustawy o szczególnych rozwiązaniach związanych z zapobieganiem, przeciwdziałaniem i zwalczaniem COVID-19, innych chorób zakaźnych oraz wywołanych nimi sytuacji kryzysowych oraz niektórych innych ustaw" from 31 March (also called "Tarczy antykryzysowej” or “anti-crisis shield”), deadlines for several administrative proceedings are suspended but it is not specified whether freedom of information falls under this category. The legislation generated debate in the Polish media where some reportsthat the law de facto suspends deadlines for providing information. IPI reports that "in Poland legal changes mean that requests depend on the willingness of the authorities to provide information." IDEA reports that "In practice, the right to information is suspended in Poland, as a result of the legal framework that enables the government to forego answering information requests within the normal timelines. " According to OSCE report (p.49), Poland is among countries that have "adopted measures or have made announcements concerning the extension of the times that public officials have to respond to freedom of information requests or may in practice delay obtaining public information." The Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) issued a statement on 15 April saying that the suspention of deadlines should not apply to access to public information since it violates Art 61 of the Constitution. The coding is based both on the statement on the President's website and several reports from trusted sources that the deadline for freedom of information requests was de facto suspended.

 (RSF) ''Journalists pressured to censor themselves: 
The country seems pluralistic but this is just a facade. There is a score of privately-owned TV stations, a similar number of newspapers and around 40 radio stations, but all are under strong pressure to censor themselves and many are owned by government allies. Since 2014, several journalists have been threatened, forced to flee the country or summarily deported for criticizing the government or inviting opposition politicians to express their views. During the 2016 presidential election, the Internet was disconnected to prevent journalists and activists from verifying and challenging the results.''

State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about COVID-19 pandemic
''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government's figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown's economic and social consequences.''

*Comments*:
 According to Reporters without Border, "media access to information is meanwhile being restricted more and more. Since 17 March, reporters cannot attend an event at which Vladimir Putin is present unless their temperature has been taken at least three times" and "on 19 March, foreign reporters were denied access to the Russian parliament." IPI reports that "Requests in Russia often go unanswered" and cites a source that says "In Russia, the closure of many regional government bodies means it is not possible to request information. Other public authorities are not responding within the legal timeframe. Examples include a request by human rights activists to the Moscow Department of IT about the facial recognition system made on 9th April. Despite a seven-day time limit for responding, there was still no response by 23rd April." 

Additionally, according to IPI, "individual medical professionals have been banned from speaking to media, while heads of health institutions have to seek approval and coordinate with central authorities before giving interviews to the press...Gathering information from “unofficial” sources or conducting anonymous interviews meanwhile risks sanctions or a police investigation." According to Human Rights Watch, " On October 28, the Health Ministry instructed all medical facilities that any public comments about the Covid-19 situation have to be pre-approved by the ministry’s press service. Later, the assistant health minister stated the instruction applied only to comments on prevention and treatment of the disease and “does not affect doctors” capacity to comment on various aspects of their work, including problematic ones." However, given the retaliation against medical personnel who offered critical comments, it’s reasonable to believe this instruction is intended to have a chilling effect."

(1) This measure prevented journalists from reporting in the field, and from access to information.
The lockdown was eased in May, but after a rise in coronavirus cases it is since then being re-imposed in selected areas.

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on June 30, 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.''

 Journalists are banned from attending daily press conferences and can send questions via email. According to IPI, the goverment "doubled the amount of time public bodies have to respond to requests. Since then, media have reported that institutions have cited the new rules in refusing to provide information."  Since the state of emergency ended on 6 May 2020, restrictions on media access are coded only during March-June 2020 period. Moreover, videos of press conferences from November seem to show that journalists are physically present and ask questions at press conferences.

However,

1: While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.

2: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection.

 There are widespread reports that the authorities are limiting access to information and concealing information about the Covid-19 situation, such as:

1) "Prior to officially recognizing COVID-19’s impact on public health, the Ministry of Health threatened medical workers, journalists, reporters, bloggers, and civil activists with criminal prosecution if they were to spread officially unconfirmed information about the disease." 

2) In May, the authorities blocked a website that was tracking Covid-19 dealths independently of the government's statistics that remains blocked at the time of coding.

3)  According to Reporters Without Borders, "The authorities are even refusing to answer journalists' questions about the more than 300 people under an extended quarantine in a hospital specializing in infectious diseases, and why the police in Khujand, the country's second largest city, have suddenly started wearing face masks. Access to the websites of most independent media outlets is blocked in Tajikistan."

Since there have been numberous violations and I found no evidence that the situation improved, meinf is coded as 2 in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 1: Any information about the virus that the government deems to be “false or capable of causing fear in the public” is punishable by up to five years in prison. This may act as a form of deterrent towards Thai jounalists and media outlets thinking about reporting on the pandemic, it’s prevalence and the government’s approach to it.

2: Government representatives at a press conference on 25 March 2020 said that they would restrict the media to only reporting official information on COVID-19 and prosecute individuals whose statements are deemed critical of authorities’ COVID-19 response are of particular concern. At the press conference Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha stated that journalists would be prevented from interviewing officials and medical personnel and restricted to only covering information disseminated at official press conferences. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s warning to “be careful about what they post on social media”, and threats of prosecutions for “abuse of social media” at a separate press conference on 24 March 2020 also fuel fears that authorities plan to disproportionately restrict online expression about COVID-19.

*Comments*:
 Much of the arrests of journalists, and charges placed on them, have been based on journalists accessing information from hospitals or hospital staff on Covid-19 which the government do not want them publishing and spreading. The Turkish government has more or less closed all access to information on Covid-19 according to Reporters withour Borders and Amnesty International, and  only wish the media to report on the information on Covid-19 released by the government itself. Furthermore, there are numerous accusations that the Turkish government have delibirately underreported the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. While there isn't as much reporting on this after June, there are no indications that the access to information has improved, and the media climate is still very restrictive with continuing arrests and detention of journalists. This is therefore coded as 2.

 Reporters without Borders report that: ”Reporters are also facing restrictions in covering the government’s daily press briefings, during which the Prime Minister or another designated official provides updates to the public on the Covid-19 situation in the country. Journalists are limited to virtual participation, and their microphones are almost always cut immediately after an initial question, with follow-up questions rarely allowed - severely limiting their ability to rigorously question the presiding official.” Furthermore, there are reports that medical personell have been ordered not to speak publicly about their work and the situation at hospitals, limiting media's access to information within these areas. The Media Freedom Rapid Response also reports that the UK government has banned openDemocracy, the Sunday Times and prevented other outlets from asking questions at the daily news briefings. This is therefore coded as 1.
While no reports have been found on this in the second period, and it is thus less certain that this is on going, no indication has been found that things have improved. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 While Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has continued to provide regular updates and information to the public, President Donald Trump, the White House Covid-19 task force, and the White House press secretary have been hostile toward the media, often refusing to answer their questions, limiting access to press briefings, and holding such briefings infrequently.  In May 2020, for example, President Trump abruptly ended a press briefing, after refusing to answer questions about Covid-19 testing - calling it a "nasty question" (1). In April 2020, President Trump refused to answer any questions at a press briefing where he suggested people should use disinfectants and light to treat Covid-19 (2). The White House Covid-19 task force led by Vice President Mike Pence did not brief the press for four months. When they did in November, they refused to take any questions (3). Likewise, in the regular White House press briefings, the Press Secretary often refuses to call on reporters critical of the government - calling them "activists" (4). Reporters without borders report on  a number of occurences, initially reported in varying media outlets in the U.S., where journalists have been denied access to information and public officials having been prohibited to talk to media from government officials (5).

 There are reports that the official government numbers are not reliable and that the government is not being transparent about the covid-19 situation in Venezuela. The government is also silencing health workers who speak out about it.

 I did not find information of the government and it's agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information. However, there has been a law that has been passed which limit access to information.

1: A new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  2: At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000.

 Several journalists have had their phones confiscated, forced to delete photo, and arrested for e.g. breaking lockdown or having an expired press card, while they were covering enforcements of lockdown, filming police roadblocks, or interviewing people allegedly tortured for attending a protest against the government's covid-19 strategy.
No information was found indicating that the violations stopped.
