No sources have been found stating that the military has additional tasks in the emergency measures, but the military presence is very large in Myanmar so it is possible that they have been involved in additional measures. No reports have been found on the military activity in these regards in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods, but as no evidence confirming that their involvement has ceased has been found, this is assumed to be on going and coded 1 for all three periods.

 The military was involved in border checks and enforcing quarantine in Litovel and Uničov municipalities in March 2020. Since end of July, the military has been involved in the "smart quarantine" project, which involves using information technology to map contacts of people who tested positive for covid-19. On 13 July, "The decision to deploy members of the Czech Armed Forces in rescue work to protect the population and prevent the spread of coronavirus was made." Since this is not part of confinement measures, military involvement is coded as 1 only during March-June 2020 period.

 During the state of emergency, the Presidential Decree nº 1017 (Art. 2/Art. 4) established "confinement measures and that the national police and armed forces are responsible for ensuring compliance". Once the state of emergency was lifted, the new mandatory guidelines defined that the armed forces would "participate in security activities and public order control".

*Comments*:
 The armed forces were tasked with enforcing the lockdown measures. Once they were lifted, they were responsible for establishing and controlling "sanitary barriers". The National Assembly argued that these were "military barriers", not sanitary, and in late October they issued a decree prohibiting the establishment of such barriers without approval of the mayor and prohibiting "intimidating and coercive use of the Armed Forces".

 Emmanuel Macron drafted the Frech army into the coronavirus efforts, but not in order to ensure confinement measures, but rather to help organize and support where the situation worsens, by tranferring patients etc.

''The army will not be called upon to ensure the strict confinement of people as has been the case in some other countries, officials said. However, it will be used to protect strategic sites such as pharmacy depots and stockpiles of medical equipment and ventilators after a recent spate of thefts. 
It will also broaden existing efforts to shuffle patients around the country and also in France’s overseas’ territories, where two warships were dispatched this week as the situation worsens there.''

The authorities also maintain police and local militia checkpoints across the country, but this seems to be related to the upheavals occurring for the past several months, in the lead up to and during the March 22 constitutional referendum and legislative elections.

*Comments*:
 The Iranian military is in charge of much of the emergency measures in terms of planning and logistics. Furthermore, in March, the military was deployed to enforce restrictions and clear public places, close down businesses etc. It is unclear how involved the military has been since then in enforcing Covid-19 regulations, but no evidence has been found showing that the military presence has been retracted, and it is thus assumed that they are still taking part in the enforcement. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

 The measures under the state of health emergency ''include a mandatory nationwide lockdown and curfew enforced by the police and the army, requiring that citizens limit their movement during the day to absolutely necessary activities. The government has been strictly enforcing the measure by requiring individuals leaving home to acquire a special permit either from their workplace or local authorities. Since March 20, authorities have arrested thousands of individuals for violating the state of emergency or for spreading false information...''

''The state of emergency allows, if necessary, the use of public force. Thus Morocco has deployed the police and even the army to control derogatory movements. Part of the faithful protested against the closure of the mosques.''

 The military has been given responsibility to "oversee the quarantine of new arrivals and audit the quarantine process" as the Guardian reports. Consequently, the military is involved in enforcing some emergency measures.The military has also been deployed in August to work on some enforcement-related tasks such as policing quarantine hotels. This is therefore coded as 1 for both periods.

As of 4 December 2020, the military continues to be involved in isolation and quarantie facilities and have hence continues to be coded as 1.

 During the first state of emergency, which ended on June 21, the Royal Decree 463/2020, Article 5, defined that the government could call the armed forces to enforce the emergency measures, and Disposición adicional quinta establishes that they had "agent of authority" power, meaning that can give orders to civilians. The second state of emergency does not forsee military participation in enforcing the emergency measures.

 The military was tasked with enforcing quarantine.  

According to Amnestry International Report, the military also closed a footbridge to a village: "On 18 April, the Ukrainian army closed a footbridge, the only access to the village of Staromaryivka situated in a government-controlled section of the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Two weeks previously the "Donetsk People’s Republic" had closed access to the nearest town in the territory held by armed groups. This meant that about 150 residents including disabled elderly people and children were cut off from shops, health services and emergency services. The reason given was to prevent transmission of COVID-19 although no cases had been identified in the village. Villagers were allowed to cross the bridge again from 22 April."

 I have not found any evidence that the military's involvement in enforcing quarantine measures was lifted, therefore military involvement is coded as 1 in all time periods.

 FEMA, who is in charge of managing and overseeing a lot of the national emergency, has not deployed the military or used the military to enforce any confinement measures. However, states have the opportunity to use the National Guard to enforse such measures, and some states have (See the rubric "is FEMA deploying the military?" in the source). The National Guard is not, however, the army organization responsible for external security. Governors can call the National Guard into action during local or statewide emergencies, such as storms, fires, earthquakes or civil disturbances.
