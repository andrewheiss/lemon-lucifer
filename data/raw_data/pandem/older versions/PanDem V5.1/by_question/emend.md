 Covid19 related measures are still in place in Algeria in December 2020.

A curfew is in effect in 29 of Algeria’s 48 provinces, including in Algiers, and has last been extended through December 16 2020.

 Still in place. On July 18 began a new phase of the isolation measures, with gradual flexibilization and opening. Most provinces had reduced the number of cases and transitioned from "mandatory social isolation" to "mandatory social distancing". However, there was a increase in numbers and several places had to adopt a new lockdown. Legally, the Decree nº 297/2020 is still in place and the measures are valid until December 20.

*Comments*:
 31 May 2020 corresponds to the end of the state of disaster in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the subnational entities). In the Serb Republic the state of emergency was lifted on earlier on 21 May 2020. I have not found any documents indicating the end of the state of disaster at the federal level, but it is logical to code it as having ended since it was lifted in both subnational entities. Moreover, Federal Civil Protection Headquarters has not issued any new orders for covid-19 measures since 31 May 2020.  For example, from the OSCE report: "The Republika Srpska declared a state of emergency on the basis of Art. 70 of the Constitution as of 3 April, which ended on 21 May, while the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of natural or other disaster on 17 March, on the basis of the Framework Lawon Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH, which ended on 31 May."

July-September and October-December: no national-level emergency measures

*Comments*:
 The state of health alert had no limit date in its issuance, however, In May 5, the Burkinabe National Assembly passed an enabling law allowing the government to rule by Ordinance for a period of 3 months, in order to deal with the pandemic. No evidence was found on whether the government extended this enabling law, and since the curfew ended on June 3, it is assumed that the law did not get prolonged.

Separate measures like the curfew and quarantine have been (partly) lifted since June 3. The resumption of domestic and international flights follows the expiration of a nationwide 2100-0400 health curfew June 3. The wearing of facemasks in public remains mandatory nationwide.

 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Time period: Q4*: 

 

*Comments*:
 On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under this new law, the state of emergency and related measures have been re-declared and extended several times. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on October 3 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. 
However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on November 15, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. The government according to media sources (see 1, 2) are seeking to prolong the existing measures until December 14, 2020, but it has not been yet validated.

*Comments*:
 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July. However, there are reports from August & September which state that "[...] we are still required under the Imposition of Restrictions Act 2020 [...]" and I have also not found evidence of it lifted/expired to date.
The president has extended the restrictions for 3 months in September.

*Time period: Q4*: 

 

*Comments*:
 March-June: Decree 282/2020 from 17 June lifted the state of emergency and terminated the Coronavirus Protection Act (Act XII of 2020 on the containment of coronavirus) from 30 March 2020. Was replaced by the state of epidemiological preparedness (Decree 283/2020) without an end date. The "LAW ON TRANSITIONAL RULES AND HEALTH PREPAREDNESS RELATED TO THE CESSATION OF THE STATE OF DANGER " from 17 June 2020 " introduces measures related to the revocation of the "state of danger" in Hungary. However, the law expands the powers of the government during another exceptional state, by authorizing the government to issue wide-ranging decrees without parliamentary approval during a “state of medical crisis.” During such a state, the law authorizes the government to suspend existing laws and restrict fundamental rights such as freedom of movement and assembly. The government may declare a “state of medical crisis” unilaterally, based on the recommendation of a government-appointed medical officer; the “state of medical crisis” can last up to six months and may be renewed by government decree. According to critics, the law gives the government expansive leeway to rule with minimal judicial and parliamentary scrutiny for an indefinite period." (ICNL) Note that the "state of medical crisis" has not been declared at the time of coding.

July-September:  a state of epidemiological preparedness  was declared until 18 December and has not ended at the time of coding.

October-December: a state of emergency was extended by 90 days on 11 November 2020 until and has not ended at the time of coding.

 March-June: Extended twice: on 14 April 2020 until 1 May 2020, on 29 April 2020 until 11 May 2020. The state of emergency was replaced by less strict quarantine measures, declared by the Chief State Sanitary Doctor.

July-September, October-December: after the end of the state of emergency, the same legal instrument (Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system) has been used to implement emergency measures, where the latest measures are in place at the time of coding (see Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated October 23, 2020 No. 58 "On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation"). Therefore, the implementation of the legal instrument has not ended at the time of coding.

 Emergency situation coded as still in place at the time of coding since I found no evidence that it has been lifted. OSCE report (p.162) says that "emergency situation" is in still place (the report was published on 17 July). I also found no evidence that the emergency situation has ended (e.g. local media reports that it is still in place). The state of emergency in certain areas ended on 10 May 2020.

*Comments*:
 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution on 18 March (1) and again on 15 April (3). On 29 April, the Prime Minister further declared a state of disaster under the Disaster Management Act 1997, with effect from 29 April to 28 October (4,5). The state of disaster was extended from 29 October to 29 April (6). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. Because the state of disaster begins as the state of emergency ends, we do not code the emergency measures as ending despite a change in legal instrument mid-quarter.

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1).

 The government of Mauritania eased measures and domestic restrictions taken under Article 60 Constitution nationwide from July 10: this includes lifting the restriction on movement between regions and the nightly 2000-0600 curfew, as well as the reopening of the airports for domestic flights. The use of protective masks is compulsory in all public spaces. The easing of these restrictions follows the resumption of public religious ceremonies and the opening of markets and restaurants nationwide.
After July 10, preventative measures are in place.

*Comments*:
 The government initially declared a 14-day period of emergency measures but these have been periodically extended. From 04 May the restrictions got gradually eased but curfews remained in place from 10pm-6am across all of Nigeria. On 04 September, Nigeria entered the third phase of eased lockdown which was planned to last four weeks. On 19 October, the measures were extended for four weeks and I found no evidence that they were extended further, therefore emend is coded as 16 November 2020. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control still lists limits on gatherings over 20 people outside of workplaces; however, no other national-level restrictions from the original regulations are listed. The Nigerian CDC also issued a set of guidelines for end-of-year travel. These include mandatory testing and quarantine (7 days) for travelers entering the country, but no formal restrictions on movement or public gatherings.

 The Executive Decree nº 507 was not revoked, but it has been altered several times.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was extended a couple of times, but was not extended beyond June 16, and has thus ended. However, on June 16, it was replaced with the National Pandemic Act, which transfers most emergency powers to this law. As most emergency powers are thus still in place, this does not count as having ended. The existence of the pandemic was declared on 17 June and is in place since without end-date
Note that some subnational state's of emergency have been kept in place or implemented, especially in the region of Bougainville. Note also that PNG introduced a new legislation (see misclimit for more information) that has some emergency powers even thoug the State of Emergency has ended. However, the national state of emergency which is the primary legal instrument here has ended.

 Some but not all measures ended: 1) the declaration and implementation of emergency measures to the heads of regional authorities does not have a time limit and has not ended at the time of coding,  2) The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin.

The last reneweal took place on September 15 for an additional period of 6 months, until March 2021:

...''the Togolese National Assembly, meeting in plenary this Tuesday, September 15, 2020, has just authorized the government to extend the exceptional measure, over a period of 06 additional months (until March 2021 therefore)....Concretely, two bills have been adopted by the legislative power: a first extending the period of authorization of the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months, and a second authorizing the public power to extend the state of emergency.
The final duration of each period should be set by presidential decree, depending on the evolution of the pandemic.''

 Sections 11 and 27 in the "Public Health Act 1935" do not mention an time limit or sunset clause. Section 14 in the "Public Health (Control of COVID-19) Rules, 2020" states that "These Rules shall expire on notification by the Minister." The Public Health Act section 11 and 27 are still active and, according to the Uganda Legal Information Institute, the Public Health Rules 2020 are still in force.

 On July 3, The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, which relaxed some emergency measures. 
Between October 14 -  November 4 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations was introduced, which categorized each local authority area under one of three levels of restrictions. 
This was revoked on November 5 and replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200), which enforced the nationwide second lockdown regulations (in effect until 1 December 2020).
On 2 December the UK government replaced  SI 1200 of November 5 with 2020 SI 2020/1374 which reintroduced a countrywide three-tier legal framework. These Regulations expire at the end of 2nd February 2021. 
As the UK still has emergency provisions in place, this does not count as it having ended.

*Comments*:
 The Civil Protection Act, section 27:2: "The declaration of a state of disaster in terms of subsection (1) shall remain in force for a period of three months, the President may, from time to time, by statutory instrument, extend such declaration". The state of disaster has not been found to no longer be in effect, and the measures, such as lockdown, are extended for an indefinite period. Thus, it seems the state of disaster is still in effect.
