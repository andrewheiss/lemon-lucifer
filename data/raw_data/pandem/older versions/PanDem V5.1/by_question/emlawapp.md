 From the information found, the President has the right to issue and sign decrees without the approval of Parliament at all times (not confined to the pandemic). 

''While the National People’s Assembly is suspended, the President of the Republic may legislate on urgent matters by issuing ordinances after consultation with the Council of State (the administrative court). Such ordinances issued by the President must be submitted to the legislative branch at its next session for ratification.''

Constitution 1989 (reinst. 1996, rev. 2016), article 99 (4): In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall: ...sign the executive decrees;

 'Under the special powers provision, decrees need to be confirmed by law within a set deadline. In the specific case of a pandemic, the decrees need to be converted within a year of their entry into force. In the absence of such confirmation they will become void. Moreover, in the contest of the coronavirus pandemic, the House of Representatives has created a new parliamentary committee devoted specifically to requesting information from, and overseeing, the members of the federal government with regard to measures taken under the 'special powers' provision.'' (1)

According to article 105 of the Belgian Constitution (special powers decrees), ''the legislator authorises the Government (formally the King at federal level) to abrogate, complete, modify or replace legislative act through royal decrees, under some conditions. The special powers act adopted under exceptional circumstances determine the rationae materiae scope of the measures that can be taken and is always time-limited. The special powers royal decrees have to be confirmed by an act of the legislator within one year of them coming into effect – which is usually a very formal procedure, even if the minority government makes it slightly less certain in this case –, otherwise they will be considered as never having produced effect. Once they are confirmed, they are considered as legislative acts.'' (2)

 The Constitution (art 85, 86, 143, 144) and the Ordinance No. 17/024 of July 10, 2017 (art 63, 64) require the approval of the declaration of the state of emergency (actually its extension beyond the 30-day initial limit) by the Senate and the National Assembly, as well as a confirmation of the constitunality of the act by the Constitutional Court. 

''The ordinance proclaiming the state of emergency or the state of siege ceases to have effect after the expiration of the period provided for in the Constitution, unless the National Assembly and the Senate, seized by the President of the Republic by decision of the Council of Ministers, did not authorize its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.''

Article 85 When grave circumstances threaten, in an immediate manner, the independence or the integrity of the national territory or when they provoke the disruption of the regular functioning of the institutions, the President of the Republic proclaims a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145 of this
Constitution.

Article 86 
The President of the Republic declares war by ordinance deliberated in the Council
of Ministers after the opinion of the Superior Council of Defense and the
authorization of the National Assembly and of the Senate, in accordance with Article
143 of this Constitution.

Article 144
In application of the provisions of Article 85 of this Constitution, the state of siege,
like the state of urgency, is declared by the President of the Republic.
The National Assembly and the Senate then convene of right. If they are not in
session, an extraordinary session is convoked to this effect in accordance with
Article 116 of this Constitution.
The closing of the ordinary or extraordinary sessions is[,] of right[,] delayed to
permit, as the case may be, the application of the provisions of the preceding
paragraph.
The state of urgency or the state of siege may be proclaimed for all or part of the
territory of the Republic for a time period of thirty days.
The ordinance proclaiming the state of urgency or the state of siege ceases[,] of
right[,] to produce its effects after the expiration of the time period specified in the
[fourth] paragraph of this article, unless the National Assembly and the Senate,
referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic on decision of the Council
of Ministers, have authorized its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.
The National Assembly and the Senate can, by way of a law, end at any moment the
state of urgency or the state of siege.

Article 145
In case of a state of urgency or of state of siege, the President of the Republic takes,
by ordinances deliberated in the Council of Ministers, the measures necessary to
respond to the situation.
These ordinances are, on their signature, submitted to the Constitutional Court
which, ceasing other matters, declares if they derogate or not from this Constitution.

 The legislature adopted the Imposition of Restrictions Act (Act 1012) on 21 March 2020, which provides the president powers to declare emergency restrictions without authorization by the parliament. So while the legislature assented to the general legislation, it did not approve the specific declaration made on 23 March.

 No, the constitution states that both the government and the parliement can declare a state of emergency, but that a government-declared state of emergency has a much shorter time limit and can be terminated by the parliament. This was a state of emergency declared by the government, and the parliament did thus not approve it. Note that the system for declaring states of emergencies (and how long they have effect) has been changed by the entrance of the Major Corona Law (see comments and sources for emlaw for more information), but the SOE is the same in the sense that the government introduced it and parliament did not vote on it.

 The Government did not need parliaments approval of declaring a state of emergency, and this is therefore coded as 0.Important to note however is that the government does need  parliament to approve any decree laws that have been issed within 60 days, and it is through these decree laws that much of the emergency measures have been taken. But the initial declaration of a state of emergency did not need parliamentary approval.

 It looks like the Parliament does not need to authorize the state of emergency. The Constitution mentions:
Article 73 - Should the institutions of the Republic......be interrupted, the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures required by these circumstances, after consultation with the President of the National Assembly, President of the Senate and the President of the Constitutional Council. He informs the Nation thereof by message. Parliament meets without requiring to be convened. The end of the crisis is recognized by a message from the President of the Republic to the Nation.
And Article 74 - The President of the Republic initiates legislation concurrently with the members of Parliament. He ensures the promulgation of laws within thirty days after the law definitively adopted has been submitted to him. This period is shortened to five days in the event of an emergency.

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid19 measures were implemented with the Presiential Directive on March 15, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020 - ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS, by the legal notice n.49 on 3rd April 2020, and the PUBLIC ORDER ACT (legal notice n.36, March 26), all with imeediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of COVID-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament’s interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of COVID-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3)

 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (7). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (4.6). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration, without requirement of parliamentary approval (8).

The Steering Committee of the Serbian Bar Association argues that the declaration of the state of emergency was declared unconstitutionally and "the decision of the President of the Republic, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency does not contain a rationale behind such decision, which makes it impossible to determine whether the conditions for the application of Article 200(5) of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia have been met, i.e. whether there was a reason why the National Assembly was unable to meet".

July-September, October-December: parliamentary approval is not required based on  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti".

 According to the Swiss Constitution - article 185, the Federal Council is authorised by law to take emergency decisions without the involvement of Parliament, but according to Article 7d of the Government and Administration Organization Act of 21 March 1997, the emergency ordinances of the government must be ratified by Parliament after six months at the latest. 

The Federal Council defined the Covid-19 crisis an “extraordinary situation” under Article 185 al. 3 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the Epidemics Act, therefore granting the Federal Council (government) with authorization by the Constitution and by law to take this decision without the involvement of Parliament.

 Section 5 of the Emergency Decree states that "the Prime Minister upon the approval of the Council of Ministers is empowered to declare an emergency situation applicable to the whole Kingdom or in some area or locality as necessary for the situation. In the case where the approval of the Council of Ministers cannot be obtained in a timely manner, the Prime Minister may declare the emergency situation immediately and shall subsequently seek the approval of the Council of Ministers within three days. If approval of the Council of Ministers is not obtained within the time prescribed, or the Council of Minister refuses approval, such declaration of emergency situation shall cease to be in force". 

However, as the council of ministers are not part of the legislature, this variable is coded as 0.

 According to Article 94 of the Constitution (1), both the state of siege and the state of urgency are declared by the President of the Republic in [the] Council of Ministers, but require the authorization by the National Assembly for their extension beyond fifteen days. During the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency, the National Assembly may not be dissolved.

Article 86 also reads that the ''Government can, for the execution of its programs, demand of the National Assembly, the authorization to take by ordinances, during a limited time period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after the opinion of the Constitutional Court. They enter into force on their publication, but become lapsed if the bill of law of ratification is not deposited with the National Assembly before the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time period defined in the enabling law, these ordinances may only be modified by the law, in that which concerns their provisions which arise in the legislative domain.''

*Comments*:
 Turkey has used the Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442) as legal instruments to implement emergency response. 
Law no. 5442 on Provincial Administration, Article 11, does not require parliamentary approval for the actions taken by the Governor: 
''a) The governor shall be the superior of all general and special law enforcement forces and organizations. He shall take necessary measures to prevent crimes from being committed, protect public order and security. For this purpose, he shall employ the general and special law enforcement forces of the State; the superiors and officers of such organizations shall be obliged to immediately execute the orders issued by the governor.
b) The governor shall secure the border and coasts of the country, and execute all affairs relating to border and coastal security according to the provisions in force.
c) The governor shall have the duty, inter alias, to secure peace and security, personal immunity, safety of private property, public well-being and the authority of preventive law enforcement.
The governor shall take necessary decisions and measures to this end. Provisions of Article 66 shall apply to those who do not comply with such decisions and measures.'' (3) 

 Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) also does not seem to need parliamentary approval: ''the General Hygiene Law (Umumi Hıfzıssıhha Kanunu) No. 1593 is accepted as the constitution of healthcare services. The Law allows for quarantine application within the scope of “combating contagious and epidemic diseases”. Isolation practices and the quarantine of a certain region are described in Article 72. Authority to decide on quarantine implementation and other measures within the scope of combating epidemic diseases is given to the Ministry of Health for the country in general by the Article 64 of the Law numbered 1593.''
