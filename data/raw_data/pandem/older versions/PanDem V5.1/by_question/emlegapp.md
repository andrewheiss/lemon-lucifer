''The draft proposal explains that the government has to keep the Chamber of Representatives informed about the measures it takes in virtue of its special powers. However, this obligation was not formalised in the final act.'' (2)
The federal government has adopted a number of Special Powers Decrees (see (6))

 The French Assemblée National approved on 21.03.2020 a legal text that would introduce a “state of health emergency” in France during the coronavirus pandemic.
The law would give the French prime minister “the power to declare, by decree and upon recommendation of the Health minister, general measures setting limits to the freedom of movement, the freedom to enterprise and the freedom to congregate and would allow him to proceed to the requisition of all necessary goods and services to fight against a health disaster.”

The law of July 11 was approved by the Constitutional Court and the National Assembly on July 9 2020.
The second state of health emergency was voted by Assemblee Nationale on November 5, 2020.

 The legislature adopted the Imposition of Restrictions Act (Act 1012) on 21 March 2020, which provides the president powers to declare emergency restrictions without authorization by the parliament. So while the legislature assented to the general legislation, it did not approve the specific declaration made on 23 March.

 As required by the Constitution, all Legislative Acts with measures against covid19 were, after their issuance, voted in the Parliament. The lockdown decision was part of a group of measures that were approved with a Legislative Act, but its specific content and details were issued through a Ministerial Decision (KYΑ Δ1 α/Γ.Π οικ 20036/2020 - ΦΕΚ 986/Β/22-3-2020) (4) , which technically does not need (nor took) parliamentary approval, but it requires authorization by being published on the Government Gazette.

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid19 measures were implemented with the Presiential Directive on March 15, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020 - ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS, by the legal notice n.49 on 3rd April 2020, and the PUBLIC ORDER ACT (legal notice n.36, March 26), all with immediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of COVID-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament's interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of COVID-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3)

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (7). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (4.6). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration, without requirement of parliamentary approval (8).

*Comments*:
 In addition to the developments below, Mali is facing internal political turbulence, and the President and Prime Minister resigned on August 18, 2020 following a military coup:
''On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta announced his resignation, explaining that he had no other choice but to submit to the will of his army in revolt to prevent blood from being spilled.'' (1)

'Mali parliamentary elections were held on March 29, 2020 (second round on April 19) despite the coronavirus situation, as they had been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on May 2 2020. (2, 3). The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on May 12.

Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on April 1 2020 that authorized the government to take covid19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from April 1 until May when the parliamentary elections will have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020. Further, because of the political instability and the military coup, no evidence was found on the bill being adopted at all.

 The Nigerien legislature adopted unanimously (90 votes in favor, zero against and zero abstentions) on April 11, 2020 the bill extending the State of Emergency until July 11, 2020. Note that when the President announced the declaration of the State of Emergency on March 27, 2020, he had not specified an end date. This was only added on April 11 when the bill passed from the National Assembly, and an extension until July 11 was given. The initial declaration did not require the approval of the Parliament.
Nigerien Parliament approved the October's extension of the state of emergency for a period of three months until January 10 2021 (see 3). 
The second extension, from July till October, was not voted in Parliament, but the government had already authorization of legislating by Ordinance during parliamentary inter-session periods: 
''This draft ordinance is made in accordance with law n ° 2020-030 of July 2, 2020, empowering the Government to issue ordinances during parliamentary inter-session and this, after opinion of the Constitutional Court. '' (see 4, 5).

*Comments*:
 March-June: The parliament was dissolved since 16 February 2020 due to parliamentary elections (i.e. not covid-19) and therefore the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency were made by the government. Each decision has provisions for the need to be approved by the parliament, as soon as it is able to meet. At the time of coding, the parliament has met and but not yet approved the decisions (both to declare a state of emergency and to extend it several times) yet.

July-September: declaration of emergency measures  based on "Zakon za zaštita na naselenieto od zarazni bolesti"  does not need to be approved by the legislature.

October-December: the declaration of a state of crisis does not need to be approved by the legislature.

 The National Disaster Management Act (2002) does not require that the National Assembly approve the declaration of the national state of disaster, its end date, or its extension. These powers belong solely to the executive. However, petitions can be brought before the courts to repeal the measure.

 According to the Swiss Constitution - article 185, the Federal Council is authorised by law to take emergency decisions without the involvement of Parliament, but according to Article 7d of the Government and Administration Organization Act of 21 March 1997, the emergency ordinances of the government must be ratified by Parliament after six months at the latest. 
The Federal Council defined the Covid-19 crisis an “extraordinary situation” under Article 185 al. 3 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the Epidemics Act, therefore granting the Federal Council (government) with authorization by the Constitution and by law to take this decision without the involvement of Parliament. 

Ordinance 1, 2 and 3 were introduced and implemented without parliamentary approval. The Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on  25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers “only to the extent that they are required to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic.” The Federal Covid-19 Act  expires on 31 December 2022.

*Comments*:
 The legislature has approved the declaration of public emergency on 27 March, and the extensions on 3 April. However, after the Parliament didn't approved another extension on 16 May, the president used an executive order to extend it. Furthermore, the second State of Public Emergency was declared and extended with executive orders and not approved by parliament. Therefore 'emlegapp' is coded as 0.
The Public Health Act does not require approval by the Parliament.

*Comments*:
 Before the president's declaration of the state of emergency, on March 30 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (1), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance, according to article 86 of the constitution.
The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.'' (4)

The definitive duration of each period should be decided by presidential decree, depending on how the pandemic evolves. The goal is to give some flexibility to measures taken in response to Covid-19; measures which, it should be noted, are taken at the council of ministers, based on the opinion of the constitutional court.

 All measures in Turkey were taken with administrative decisions generally in the form of presidential or ministerial circulars (legally atypical regulatory acts are almost at the bottom of the hierarchy of norms, and they cannot be contrary to laws and regulations. Typically, circulars are issued only for clarifying provisions of laws and regulations.)
None of the decisions except one declared directly by the Presidency were published in the Official Gazette and most legal professionals, let alone ordinary citizens, would have a difficult time finding the original texts of these circulars and decisions.''

The Parliament is merely informed that such declaration has been made. Section 28 of the Civil Protection Act states: "Where a state of disaster has been declared in terms of section twenty-seven, the Minister shall communicate such declaration to Parliament on the day that it next sits after the declaration is made."
