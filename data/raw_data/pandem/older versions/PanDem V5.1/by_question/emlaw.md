 March-June: state of natural disaster; based on the Constitution, emergency measures can be taken during " a state of war, state of emergency or natural disaster " (Art 170 (1)). State of natural disaster is different from state of emergency. According to Art 174 (1) of the Constitution, "for the prevention or the avoidance of the consequences of natural disasters or technological accidents, the Council of Ministers may decide on the state of natural disaster for a period not longer than 30 days, in one part or in the whole territory of the state."; According to OSCE report, "state of Natural Disaster, different from a “state of emergency”, declared by the Council of Minister on 24 March, later extended upon the consent of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania, as per Art.s 170-175 of the Constitution, and ended on 23 June."

July-September:  the primary legal instrument for this time period is Constitution (Article 101) that was used to declare Normative Act no. 3, dated 15.3.2020 and that was amended several times (e.g. the Normative Act no. 30, dated 20.07.2020 “On some amendments and additions to the Normative Act no. 3, dated 15.3.2020, of the Council of Ministers")

October-November: Order 616 from 09.11.2020 from the Minister of Health based on the Law No.15/2016 "For the prevention and fighting infections and infectious diseases".

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Algeria adopted several gradual measures through decrees. The decrees are based on the Constitution (1) and other legal acts, but the articles on which they are based are not related to emergency powers, but rather to ''normal'' lawmaking powers. 
For example, the decrees  No. 20-69 of March 21 2020 (2), and 20-70 of March 24 2020 (3) refer legally to the Constitution, articles 99 (4) and 143 (1), or the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 correspondant au 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail (4).

''The Algerian Government has gradually taken a series of general measures that have been the subject of two main texts:
a) Executive Decree No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020 (2) relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19); 
b) Executive Decree No. 20-70 of March 24, 2020 (3) establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) susc as restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.'' (5,6) 

As of December 2020, the Algerian Government continues to use the same legal instrument in order to issue regulations in forms of Executive Decrees to deal with Covid 19 (see a list of such decrees: 7)

 Australia has nationally declared a Human Biosecurity Emergency.
This is a specific legal instrument that is separate from the Disaster and Emergency Management Act (referenced), and this is thus coded as 2, i.e. a public health emergency.

*Comments*:
 Austria has a state of emergency legislation, but this has not been used. Instead, Austria have implemented a number of new laws (e.g. Covid-19 Law, Second Covid-19 Law and then subsequent legislation for the reopening of Austria, as well as a larger amendment of the Covid-19 Law on September 26) within the existing legal framework, and based primarily on the Epidemics Act. Through the new laws, the government has been given an extraordinary set of powers to address Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 4. Worth noting is that the current primary legal instrument for taking measures on Covid-19 (as of November 17) is the ”COVID-19 Emergency Measures Ordinance - COVID-19-NotMV”.

*Comments*:
 A special quarantine regime but not a state of emergency declared by the Cabinet of Ministers on 24 March 2020. Under the special quarantine regime, initially people over 65 years old were prohibited from leaving home and assembly of more than 10 people was prohibited. According to OSCE report, Azerbaijan is among countries that "mainly relied on existing sanitation, health
safety and/or disaster legislation that gives the authority to put in place restrictive measures." Note on sources: the links from the official government website (https://cabmin.gov.az/) do not work as of 17 Novemberr 2020 due to the expiration of the website's security certificate, so they were replaced with links from the official covid-19 website.

*Time period: Q4*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 Bangladesh did not declare a state of emergency. It instead declared a country-wide "general holiday", which was imposed for two weeks from 26 March. This was later extended until 5 May, then extended to 16 May and finally 30 May 2020. The scope of the "general holiday" was extensive with the closure of all government and private offices, schools and universities and subject to stringent exceptions, all courts including the Supreme Court. 

Whenever any new COVID-19 case is detected, the concerned suburb, village or district is placed under "lockdown" which is often done by an oral administrative order, so it is possible to have both a "public holiday" and also a "lockdown" as emergency measures taken at  the same time.

*Comments*:
 No state of emergency declared and the measures included: Resolution of the Council of Ministers 208 from 8 April 2020 that resticted people in self-isolation from leaving their home and Resolution of the Council of Ministers 171 from 25 March 2020 (amended on 24 April 2020, 26 June 2020) establishing rules for transport operators and people arriving from certain foreign countries (the list of countries that do not require self-isolation was last amended on 11 June 2020). On 24 April, the President signed a decree introducing measures to support the economy. According to OSCE report, such regulations are of "rather limited scope". According to OECD, Belarus has introduced only some containment measures and no "comprehensive containment measures".  Nevertheless, I coded them as part of the emergency response similar to International IDEA.

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Belgium invoked Article 105 of the Constitution that gives Special powers to the executive in order to pass legislation dealing with Covid19 (1; 2; 3). On 27 March 2020 the adoption of the Special Powers Act took place, with two enabling covid19 laws: Article 3 of Law COVID-19 (I) (No 1104/5), and Article 5 of Law COVID-19 (II) (No 1104/6) (see 5, 6). The Special Powers Act was due to expire (and expired) on June 30 2020 (10).

Based on the authorization of the Special Powers Act, the Belgian government passed several Decrees containing a package of measures (for a full list see (4)).
However, the first strict measures limitting civil liberties and fundamental rights was passed before the  Special Powers Act. In fact, the ministerial decree of 23 March that included the most strict provisions was taken 4 days earlier, and while it provided that the measures adopted were only applicable until 5 April, it has been amended several times to extend this deadline and has formed the basis of all consequent decrees (see 7, 8). 

''After the two special powers laws of March 27 2020 expired on June 30, the Belgian government, although it could and should have adopted a new law on special powers, it did not do so. Since Belgium is a federal state, the federated authorities - the regions and communities - can logically also make use of special powers, which most of them have done. The nature and extent of the special powers granted by the legislators of these federated entities are quite variable when compared to each other but also when compared to federal laws of special powers, some special powers resembling full powers. (8) 

The government issued on June 30 a Ministerial Decree ''portant des mesures d’urgence pour limiter la propagation du coronavirus COVID-19 (11), which was being used and continuously updated to deal with covid19 between July-September. This Order had an initial limit date until 31 August 2020.

This Order was amended by Ministrial Order of 23 October 2020 (12), with an initial limit date of 19 novembre 2020.

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually without a specific reference to a legal instrument. Measures were  were taken at the Council of Ministers signed by the Minister of Interior. The first 11 measures on March 17, 2020 were general in nature and applied to the national level. The more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the covid19 health cordon, applied to the affected areas. 

Health cordon: taken on March 23, is established to count from Monday March 30, 2020 at 00h, a sanitary cordon around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic that are Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 
''On April 14, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: After the evaluation of the measures taken by the Government as part of the response to the CORONAVIRUS pandemic (Covid-19), the cordon cordon established as of March 30, 2020 is maintained until Monday April 27, 2020 at midnight.''
''The said cordon is extended to new localities and now includes the following municipalities: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro -Missérété, Adjara, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).''

On May 11 the gvm lifted the health cordon. Face masks have also become mandatory.

*Time period: Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 The Burkinabe Council declared a state of health alert (2) in accordance with article 66 of the Public Health Code (1) (1994) through a press release on March 26, 2020, with which it also decided to issue a decree ((3) - Decret no 2020- 0215)) establishing:
a) a two-week quarantine (starting on March 27, 2020) in the cities of Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Boromo, Houndé, Dédougou, Banfora, Manga and Zorgho, and  to be extended to any city where a positive COVID-19 case will occur.
b) a two (02) week extension of the closure of all school facilities and activities throughout the national territory. The recovery date is set for April 14, 2020 but could see a rearrangement depending on the evolution of the epidemic.

However, there had been several concerns raised over the legitimation and legal basis of the government's state of health alert (see 4, 5):
a) the state of health alert had not been issued through a decree, nor did it have a limit date (only the separate measures do) (5). 
b) the decree establishing the curfew has no legal basis, since it only vaguely refers to the Constitution, nor the curfew was instituted with reference to  the state of health alert. 
c) critics point to the non-existent source in the public health code of the measures restricting rights and freedoms taken by the authorities within the framework of the state of health alert: the public health code article cited (66) only allows for measures of a sanitary nature (hygiene and prophylaxis), and not for a curfew etc.

Yet, although the government was lacking a clear legal basis for the above measures, and it had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the covid19 package of measures, during the Council of Ministers on April 16 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill for an enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see (8, 9 )). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law. The ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after consulting the Constitutional Council. They come into force as soon as they are published, but become null and void if the ratification bill is not submitted to the National Assembly before the date set by the enabling law. At the end of the period mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the ordinances can only be modified by law in those of their provisions which are in the legislative domain."

The bill on the enabling law providing the government with the legal basis to take urgent covid19 actions within three months was voted on May 5 by the National Assembly (see 10) (Law no 015-2020/AN du 05 mai 2020). There was no evidence found on whether the law was extended after the 3 months limit-period. Measures taken after that are more general in nature, like the mandatory wearing of face masks.

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has a state of emergency legislation in the constitution (Chapter XI), but this has not been used. Maynmar has however had a national level emergency response, for example closing borders, imposing curfews and restricting gatherings. Myanmar has continued to issue such measurements during the fall of 2020, such as stay at home orders in some townships and extending flight bans. No reference has been found to any existing or new legislation in these meaures, and this is therefore coded as 5 - a national level emergency response without specific reference to a legal instrument.

However, the laws passed through can still be enacted. Article 22 on the constitution states 'When the nation faces danger, the King shall make a public proclamation placing the country in a state of emergency, after unanimous agreement from the Prime Minister, the President of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate."

*Time period: Q4*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister of Cameroon announced with a Special declaration on March 17, 2020, a total of thirteen measures. The measures have started being eased gradually since June.

The measures were not based on a legal instrument, nor were issued through a decree.

''In Cameroon, emergency law is solely the prerogative of the President of the Republic. He alone can declare a state of emergency “when circumstances so warrant” or a state of siege “in the event of a serious threat to the nation’s territorial integrity or to its existence, its independence or institutions” (Article 9 of the Constitution). So far, Cameroon’s government has not declared a state of emergency.
Apart from these exceptional powers of the President of the Republic prescribed in the constitution, there is no emergency legal framework applicable in the event of a health emergency....Cameroon could, as has been done in many countries, fill this vacuum by adopting a legal framework tailored to the situation and which could possibly be used to manage future situations. It has not, however, as of yet.
Instead, Cameroon has chosen to base the fight against COVID-19 on its existing legal framework. The fight against COVID-19 is a public health issue which, according to Cameroonian law, is a component of public order. The protection of public order is the responsibility of executive authorities, which have the power to adopt any executive orders for its preservation. As of now, all the measures taken in the context of the fight against COVID-19 are administrative measures, but as we shall see, they have different legal qualities and force.'' (1)

*Comments*:
 Canada has a state of emergency legislation, the Emergency Act, but this has not been activated. Instead, the government uses existing legal framework such as the Quarantine Act, Human Pathongen and Toxins Act, Public Health Act and Public Health Agency of Canada Act to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Furthermore, they have approved laws relating to Covid-19 (Covid-19 Emergency Response Act 1 and 2) but these are not emergency measures that affect any democratic rights, but only provide financial aid to different sectors and groups. The emergency response, and declarations of states of emergency, have instead been conducted more or less entirely at the provincial level. Therefore, this is coded as 6, i.e. they have no national level emergency response because that response is handled by the provinces.

*Time period: Q4*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 Central African Republic took a series of gradual measures, without a specific reference to a legal instrument. The measures were announced through Press releases.

''It was also highlighted that the Government seemed to refer to the Constitution primarily for electoral purposes instead of invoking it for addressing the country's urgent needs due to the disastrous impact of COVID-19.  The Constitution indeed authorises the President to declare a state of emergency or use 'exceptional powers' in exceptional circumstances. Declaring a state of emergency would have allowed the National Assembly to enact a public health emergency law to address the effects of the pandemic. However, the government did not make use of these provisions - or any specific law - as a basis for the de facto emergency measures that it imposed on the population.''

 China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures a region will implement, with level 1 the most serious. Officials in the different regions are separately in charge of their own areas. The emergency response law is triggered when the region goes into level 1. However, the measures that can be taken according to the emergency response law is very vague (Third source link). These laws have been enacted since January 2020.

 Croatia did not declare a state of emergency or disaster, and instead used existing legislation (the Civil Protection Act, the Law on Prevention of Infectious Diseases) to implement emergency measures, announced by decisions of the The Civil Protection Authority. The first measures under this legal instrument are from 19 March 2020. The same legal instrument was used for all time periods (for example, March-June: decision to limit social gatherings from 19 March , July-September: decision to limit the working hours of night clubs from 10 July, October-December: decision on restricting social gatherings from 25 October).

The same legislation was used in March prior to the state of emergency. This legislation allows the Minister of Health to make decisions on "prohibition or limitation of contact of groups of natural persons suspected of being infected with other natural persons" (such as banning mass gatherings) ( Section 80(1)(g), Section 69(1)(b) and (2))

The Constitution (2005): articles 85, 86, 144, 145 (provisions on a state of emergency). 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.
After the lifting of the state of emergency, there are social distancing measures in place, and the mandatory wearing of face masks, but these do not seem to have been taken under a specific legal instrument.

*Comments*:
 The Danish government proposed an amedment to the Act on Measures against Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Epidemiloven) that grants the Minister of Health powers that include limiting gatherings of people, prohibiting access to means of transportation and order people who are suspected of being infected to isolate.
This amendment is the legal instrument through which the initial emergency measures were taken, and this is therefore coded as 4.

 A state of emergency was declared via the Presidential Decree nº 1017, from March 16 and it was extended three times. After the third extension, the Constitutional Court announced that another extension would not be accepted, so the state of emergency ended in September. Once it expired, it was replaced by a set of mandatory guidelines without specific reference to legal instruments.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15. Once the state of emergency was lifted, the president declared the implementation of sanitary barriers in cities with a high number of cases, without specific reference to legal instruments.

*Comments*:
 On Monday March 23, 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a health state of emergency, initially declared for a period of two months from March 24, 2020 to May 24, 2020, and extended until July 10 2020, when it was lifted (Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 - The “Emergency Law”) (6). 

On 11 July a new law came into effect (LOI n° 2020-856 du 9 juillet 2020 (9)) that outlined the conditions for lifting  the state of health emergency and organizing the transition  period. This law contained several restrictions on civil liberties such as that  the  Prime  Minister could still be allowed to regulate gatherings and movement, and to close establishments. This law was brought before the Constitutional Council, which ruled the Law was according to the Constitution, but noted that the powers of the PM to regulate or prohibit the movement of people and vehicles under certain conditions can only be pronounced for the period from 11 July to 30 October 2020 and only in areas with a high circulation of  the  virus, and cannot prohibit people from leaving their homes. (8).

On  17  October  2020, the health  state  of  emergency was reinstated in  France (10), based on the Public Health Code and through the Decree No.2020-1257 that indicates that the Covid-19 epidemic constitutes a health crisis in France (8). 

Although the French Constitution (1958) and primary law deals with emergency situations by virtue of three sets of provisions: (i) 'presidential exceptional powers' (Article 16 of the Constitution), ii) the 'state of siege' (Article 36 of the Constitution and Article L. 2121-1 of the Defence Code),  and iii) the 'state of emergency' (Law No 55-385 of 1955)), the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 is new legislation. 
This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code (8), allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''
The new Emergency Law is temporary, and it is due to expire entirely by April 1, 2021. It also needs the approval of the legislature if it is going to be implemented for more than 1 month.

''These provisions supplement a preexisting article of the Public Health Code, article 3131-1, which allows the minister of health to order “any measure proportionate to the risks and appropriate to the circumstances … to prevent and limit the consequences” of a serious health threat to the population. This provision was considered inadequate on its own to deal with a crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, as it placed almost the entire burden of the response on the minister of health. The new provisions, by contrast, are meant to create a more solid and comprehensive framework that involves the entire government.'' (5)

On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law (based on Constitution, article 47) allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days. Under the new law, the state of emergency continued, although under a different legal instrument (Constitution, but provision that gives special powers to the executive). (5)

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken toward Covid-19 are primarly done by the German states, and the federal government acts as a coordinating unit. Furthermore, the German constitution includes a state of emergency-clause,  but this has not been activated (different types of states of emergency has however been enacted at the state level). The main emergency measures have been taken under the Infectious Diseases Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which is a federal law, but the adoption of the measures is taken by the states under this Law, not the federal government. It is worth noting that the federal government has taken several measures, not least in subsequently amending the Infectious Diseases Act and also passing financial aid packages. The Infectious Diseases Act saw amendments in March and May to adjust to the situation of Covid-19, and yet another amendment in November. This final amendment has caused debate in Germany as some (predominantly right wing) groups deem it too far reaching, but in terms of how the legal instrument works it keeps the setup of the states implementing the measures that the amendment enables. The primary emergency response thus exists at the state level, and this is therefore coded as 6.

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1) has provisions for giving extraordinary powers to the executive in emergency situations other than war (art 44). To deal with the pandemic, the greek government has been using art 44 of the Constitution throught the covid19 pandemic as the legal instrument to legislate on covid19 related matters. This instrument gives the executive the power for ''fast-track'' law-making, through the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''. These Acts need parliamentary approval after their issuance, and are usually accompanied by the so-called ''Common Ministerial Decisions'' (KYA in greek), which are government decisions that specify in more detail the general measures taken with the Acts.

*Comments*:
 Haiti declared a state of health emergency on March 19, 2020 for a period of one month through an executive decree (1; 2). The President is ruling by decree since January 2020, because the elections that were supposed to take place in October 2019 were not held, therefore the mandate of the Haitian legislature expired on January 13, 2020, and ever since no legislature exists (7). The Constitution has a clause on states of emergency but there wasn't any legal reference to it in the measures taken (8). 
After the lifting of the state of emergency in July 2020, there are still other measures in place, the strictest of which is a night time curfew from 12 midnight to 4 A.M (latest update available: October 19). Face masks are mandatory (9).

*Comments*:
 The Executive Decree PCM-005-2020 declared a state of health emergency based on the procurement law and the Executive Decree PCM-022-2020 suspended constitutional guarantees based on a constitutional clause. Thus, I consider that the suspension of constitutional guarantees is the measure that most closely resembles a state of exception.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong has a type of state of emergency legislation called Emergency Regulations Ordinance (for example used to quell protests in the Fall of 2019), but this has not been used in relation to Covid-19. Instead, the government imposed a number of measures between January and March that were based on existing statutes, and the on March 27 issued new regulation under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. On March 27, Hong Kong authorities announced a new regulation called 599G Regulation that controls freedom of assembly, where they can ban any public gatherings over four people (it was subsequently amended to two people, but seem to be back at four people at the moment) under a specified period of no more than 14 days. Within this legislation, authorities are also given extended powers such as entering places without warrants. This is here regarded as the main legal instrument in the emergency response, and is new legislation taken under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, and this is therefore coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 March-June: Government Decree 40/2020 declaring a special state of emergency called "state of danger" based on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53).

July-September: Governmental Decree no. 283/2020 on introducing a state of epidemiological preparedness based on Act CLIV of 1997 on healthcare, section 247 (1b). Section 247 (1b) was amended by Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules and epidemiological preparedness related to the cessation of the state of danger ("2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről".  Section 247 (1b) authorizes the government to declare a state of epidemiological preparedness ("járványügyi készültséget ").

October-December: Government Decree 478/2020 declaring a special state of emergency called "state of danger" (same legal instrument as in March-June) based on the Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53) and on Act No. CXXVIII of 2011 concerning disaster management and amending certain related acts (Article 51, introduced by Act LVIII of 2020 on the transitional rules and epidemiological preparedness related to the cessation of the state of danger ("2020. évi LVIII. törvény a veszélyhelyzet megszűnésével összefüggő átmeneti szabályokról és a járványügyi készültségről" )). Fundamental Law of Hungary (Article 53) is considered the primary legal instrument because it most closely resembles a "state of exception."

*Comments*:
 India has not declared a state of emergency. Instead on 24 March 2020, the central government invoked the National Disaster Management Act. It has declared Covid-19 to be a disaster within Section 10 of the NDMA. This authorizes the National Disaster Management Authority to issue binding directions and guidelines to the several state governments, for the purposes of addressing a disaster. It centralizes the sphere of operations, giving the federal government overriding powers of enforcement.

*Comments*:
 Iran has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 79), but this has not been activated. They have implemented several emergency measures, such as curfews, school closings, closing religious and public places and so on, but this has not been in reference to any such legal instrument. Likewise, the reentrance of several measures during October and November had no references to legal instruments as far as have been found. This is therefore coded as 5, Iran has a national level emergency response but without any specific legal instrument for those emergency measures.

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Ireland has an emergency legislation, but it only allows for declaring states of emergency "in time of war or armed rebellion". The Irish government and parliament thus made a substantial amendment to the existing Health Act (the amendment is called Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) which gives the Minister of Health power to restrict gatherings, implement lockdowns, travel restrictions and the like. The main national level emergency response has thus been taken under this legal instrument, which is a new amendment, and therefore coded as 4. The legislation was most recently debated on October 22, where the Irish parliament decided to extend the legislation from November 9 2020 to June 9 2021, and it thus continues to operate as main legal instrument for measures toward Covid-19.

 The Israeli Prime Minister declared a state of emergency on March 19, based on Article 38 and 39 in the constitution. This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within existing legal framework.
Note that Israel passed a new law on July 21 called the "Major Corona Law", that gives government extended powers during a state of emergency as well as allowing them to declare it for 60 days instead of 7 days. The initial state of emergency and extensions of it were taken under the articles mentioned above, but the current are taken under this new Major Corona Law. Most recently, it was extended from November 5 to January 3 2021.

*Comments*:
 A State of Emergency was declared by the Italian Government on 31 January, with reference to the Legislative Decree No. 1 of 2 January 2018. This is thus not a constitutional state of emergency, but one taken with under regular legislation.
Note that a number of decrees also have been issued after this to perform a number of emergency measures, but the initial emergency response is this declaration of a state of emergency. In late July, the State of Emergency was extended to October 15. On October 7, it was decided to extend it yet again, to January 31 2021.

*Comments*:
 The Jordanian King declared a state of emergency on March 19, by a Royal Decree. The legal basis for this state of emergency is the Article 124 in the Jordanian Constitution. The declaration did not declare an end date, and it is thus not fully clear in the sources if it is still ongoing. However, as can be found from sources such as ACAPS and Garda, Jordan is still taking a lot of measures against Covid-19 (for instance reinstating lockdowns and curfews), and there is no indication given that the state of emergency has ended. This is therefore coded as 1, a state of emergency within the existing legal framework, for all periods.

*Comments*:
 March-June: Decree 285 issued by the President on 15 March 2020 declaring a state of emergency from 16 March 2020 until 15 April 2020. The state of emergency ended on 11 May 2020.

July-September, October-December: emergency measures were implemented using "the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system" that was amended several times.

For example, resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated July 3, 2020 No. 44 "On the introduction of strict restrictive quarantine measures" that is based the Order of the Minister of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated February 25, 2015 No. 130 "On approval of the List of infectious diseases, with the threat of the emergence and spread of which restrictive measures are introduced, including quarantine" (amended on 5 June 2020), which in turn is based on the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system (18 September 2009 version). Since the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system resembles the closest state of exception (based on paragraph 6 of Article 144, paragraph 4 of Article 150), it is considered the primary legal instrument.

In October, one of the measures was Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated October 23, 2020 No. 58 "On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" based on the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system (last amended on 7 July 2020).

 The Kenyan Public Health Act (1) is the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various actions during public health crises, including declaring an infectious disease a “notifiable infectious disease” or a “formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease,” and taking the necessary prevention and suppression measures to fight the disease.  Specific powers accorded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country.''

Kenyan authorities (MUTAHI KAGWE, the Cabinet Secretary for Health) declared on the Government Gazzette on March 2, 2020 (3):
(a) the coronavirus 2019 disease as a notifiable disease for the purposes of section 17 (1) of the Public Health Act, and 
(b) that the provisions of Part IV of the Public Health Act shall apply with respect to the  prevention, control and suppression of the coronavirus 2019 disease.
This allowed the government to take the necessary measures in order to deal with the covid19 pandemic the same way as other formidable or notifiable diseases that are already included in the Act.

The first activation of the Public Health Act (Sections 35 and 36) to deal with the pandemic occurred on April 3, 2020, with LEGAL NOTICE No . 49 - 
THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020  (4), which has been updated ever since a few times (for the full list of legislation, see 8).

Before that, the Public Order Act (2003) (9) was activated -now the Public Order (State Curfew) Order 2020- effected by Legal Notice No. 36 of the Kenya Gazette Notice of 26th March 2020, imposing the countrywide curfew in Kenya, which was the strictest measure compared to the ones issued previously. (10).

Before March 26, a few other more general measures and guidelines had been issued (see 5, 6, 7).

# Kuwait

*Time period: Q4*: 5

 

*Comments*:
 Kuwait has issued a number of measures (e.g. curfews, closing of schools and workplaces, restricting religious gatherings), with many of these starting on March 12. But there is no mention of any state of emergency having been declared, or any legal instrument being referred to when implementing these measures. Garda and the U.S. Embassy for example makes no mention of any such state of emergency, and ACAPS who records all policies taken during the crisis has no mentioning of declaring of a state of emergency. Therefore, this is coded as 5 as there is a national level emergency response, but no legal instrument or declared state of emergency.

*Comments*:
 On 22 March, the Kyrgyz Security Council  declared emergency situation regime in the whole country (Decision 93 from 22 March 2020) which is in place at the time of coding. On 24 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the cities of Bishkek, Osh, Jalal-Abad and the Nookat and Kara-Suu districts of the Osh region and the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad region from 25 March that ended on 10 May. The capital Bishkek was under a state of emergency from 9 to 16 October following unrest after presidential elections (not part of the emergency response).

Note that although other sources refer to the emergency regime in the whole country as "state of emergency" (ICNL, International IDEA), here it is coded as emergency situation regime ( Art. 2 (4) ("chrezvychaynaya situatsiya") of the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018)) and not as state of emergency (Constitutional law on states of emergency)

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister issued a decree that specifies and regulates the main emergency measures in Laos, for example public gatherings, public transport, border closure etc. This is not taken in reference to any state of emergency or existing regulations, and is thus regarded as adopting a new law. No other instrument has been found that manages the emergency response, and the latest restrictions seem to also be based on the same legal instrument. Therefore, this is coded as 4 for all the periods.

*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 Lebanon declared a state of emergency on March 16. Sources like  Garda, UNDP, ACAPS and Human Rights Watch regard it a state of emergency rather than a public health emergency or state of disaster. Furthermore, ACAPS state that: "The Government invoked Article 2 of 1983 National Defense Law, which stipulates that the Government may declare general mobilization when a threat is endangering the population.".
Consequently, this  is coded as a state of emergency within existing legal framework.
It was subsequently extended to December 31 2020, and it was last used to reimpose a lockdown in mid-November.

# Lesotho 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 3

 
*Time period: Q4*: 3

 

*Comments*:
 rime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (4). The official notice of the state of emergency was not gazetted until 27 March, in which it was stated to be made retroactive until 18 March (2). Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (3). As such, the state of emergency would have been set to expire on 31 March 2020. According to some interpretations - the 14 day period begins with the gazette notice and thus would have ended 08 April 2020 (5). Meanwhile, on 25 March, the Prime Minister issued  a nation-wide curfew in effect from 29 March to 29 April (6).

On 15 April 2020, Prime Minister Thabane issued another declaration of a state of emergency until 28 April (7). Meanwhile, the emergency restrictions from the first declaration had remained in effect, despite being expired. 

On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (8,9). On 22 April, the Prime Minister announced an extension of the nationwide lockdown under the state of emergency and Public Health Act of 1970. These measures would remain in place until 05 May 2020 (10). 

On 28 April 2020, the National Assembly of Lesotho refused to approve a six-month extension of the state of emergency, citing concerns that it could be used for political gain and encouraging the government to instead use the state of national disaster (12).

On 06 May 2020, the Prime Minister issued a decree lifting the nationwide lockdown, but keeping in place several other restrictions through 19 May 2020. This decree includes reference to "the disaster induced state of emergency declared ... under section 3 and 15 of the Disaster Management Act, 1997" (11). No other document formally declaring such a state of disaster was located - but based on this we are left to assume that such a state of disaster was declared after Parliament refused to extend the state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (15). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (13). On 29 October, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months (until 29 April 2021). This also aligns with the initial decree being for 6 months (14).

 The authorities have also announced state-level emergency from 26 February (Resolution 152 ‘On Declaration of State-Level Emergency (Dėl valstybės lygio ekstremalios situacijos paskelbimo‘), which is still in place at the time of coding. Note that state-level emergency ("ekstremaliajai situacijai", Law on Civil Protection, Art 2 (1)) is different from state of emergency ("nepaprastąją padėtį", Art 144 of the Constitution). The government decided to maintain the state-level emergency after quarantine ended on 17 June (Resolution 588  "Dėl Lietuvos Respublikos Vyriausybės 2020 m. vasario 26 d. nutarimo Nr. 152 „Dėl valstybės lygio ekstremaliosios situacijos paskelbimo“). Since it amended Resolution 152 from 26 February, the primary legal instrument is considered to be Law on Civil Protection (Resolution 152 "Dėl valstybės lygio ekstremaliosios situacijos paskelbimo"). Note that state-level emergency ("ekstremaliajai situacijai", Law on Civil Protection, Art 2 (1)) is different from state of emergency ("nepaprastąją padėtį", Art 144 of the Constitution).

# Malawi 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The national-level emergency measures have been implemented by the Ministry of Health, pursuant under the Public Health Act and the declaration of Covid-19 as a "formidable disease" by the Ministry of Health on 01 April (6). 

On 20 March 2020, the President declared a state of disaster in Malawi, under the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act (3,4). Pursuant under this law, a state of disaster shall be in force for three months from the date specified in the declaration, but may end sooner or be extended by formal announcement in the gazette (4,5). No such early termination or extension could be located in the gazette notices, so we assume this state of disaster ended around 20 June 2020. 

Nevertheless, as Government Notice No. 5 of 2020 states, "These rules are enforceable whether or not a state of disaster in relation to Covid-19 is in force under the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act" (2). No mention of the state of disaster is made in the subsequent regulations issued after June. Therefore, we code for the entire period the main legal instrument as the Public Health Act, rather than the Disaster Preparedness Act. Further, because the Public Health Act does not provide for a state of public health emergency - and none such emergency has been declared under another legal instrument - we code this as being a case of other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 

On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020). These regulations came with reference to "section 31 of the Public Health Act" and the "declaration of the Corona Virus Disease as a formidable disease on the 1st day of April 2020" (2). This document also states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. 

On 14 April, the President and the Minister of Health announced a 21-day lockdown under the rules established by Government Notice No. 5. However, the courts issued an injunction against the lockdown on 17 April. Other measures under the Government Notice No. 5 appear to have remained in place without a clear end date.

On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. These regulations came with reference to "section 31 as read with section 29 of the Public Health Act and pursuant to the declaration of Covid-19 as a formidable disease on the 1st day of April 2020" (1).

On 20 September, the courts had their final say on lockdowns, ruling them to fall outside of the Public Health Act jurisdiction and that such measures limited oversight and accountability (7). Other regulations remain in place.

# Malaysia 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Malaysia has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 150), but this has not been used. Instead, the government has issued emergency measures and regulations under The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988, which puts the Minister of Health in charge and allows him/her to issue regulations. The most significant such regulation instituted under this law is the Movement Control Order, which was put in effect on March 20 and regulates freedom of movement, association, closing of public places, bussiness and borders, and the like. As these are new regulations enacted by the government through an existing legal instrument, this is coded as 4. 
The Movement Control Order was extended on August 28 and is set to end at December 31. This new legislation eases some of the restrictions, and is called a recovery movement control order, but still keeps a lot of the restrictions in place. It was most recently used to impose conditional movement control orders in several states on November 9.

 "In addition to the state of emergency which prevails in our country due to the security context, the state of health emergency is decreed. A curfew is also decreed. It will be rigorously applied from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., until further notice, starting at midnight on Thursday, March 26, 2020, " President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita (2)

The state of (health) emergency was issued based on:
Constitution, articles 49, 50, 72, 74; (1)
accompanied by law 2017 055 of November 6, 2017 on the state of emergency and state of siege (3)

Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted. 

No information could be found on whether the state of health emergency continues in Mail after its initial declaration. The night-time curfew was lifted on May 9 2020, and after that date there are preventative measures in place like social disctancing guidelines and the mandatory wearing of face masks. 
One possible explanation for the lack of information, or the potential end of the state of health emergency, relates to the politcal instability facing Mali after August 2020. The President and Prime Minister resigned on August 18 2020 following a military coup, and Mali has been without a president and without a government since August 18. The country is led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita.

'Mali parliamentary elections were held on March 29, 2020 (second round on April 19) despite the coronavirus situation, as they had been postponed several times since 2018. The legislature's mandate at the time was to expire on May 2 2020. The new president of the National Assembly was finally elected on May 12.
Because of the above, the Cabinet of Ministers of Mali passed a bill on April 1 2020 that authorized the government to take covid19 related measures by ordinances, with a duration period from April 1 until May when the parliamentary elections will have been concluded. No evidence was found on whether the bill was eventually adopted by the new Parliament after May 2020. Further, because of the political instability and the military coup, no evidence was found on the bill being adopted at all.

*Comments*:
 In Mauritania initially the government in mid-March 2020, took various gradual measures without a reference to a specific legal instrument, which were announced through Press Releases (Communiqués) (see list of all measures (3)). 
These measures included the suspension of all events and demonstrations, restriction of border crossings (March 15), a night curfew (March 18), prohibition of all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) as of Sunday, March 29 at 12:00 noon, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods (March 28).

On April 1, 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991) (1), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: (2)

''Article 60 -After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers and require the approval of the President of the Republic[,] who signs them. They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

After July 10 when the government lifted the strict restrictions, there are preventative measures in place and the wearing of masks is mandatory, but these measures do not seem to be taken under the emergency framework of article 60 of constitution.

*Comments*:
 March-June: Decision No. 55 by the parliament to declare a state of emergency, which lasted from 17 March until 15 May. The declaration of the state of emergency was based on Constitution (Article 66 m) and Law 212 (2004) (Article 12) on states of emergency ("LEGE Nr. 212 din 24-06-2004 privind regimul stării de urgenţă, de asediu şi de război"). The Constitution is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles a "state of exception."

July-September: National public health emergency ("starea de urgenţă în sănătate publică") was declared from 16 May and lasted until 30 September. It was declared based on Art 58. of "LEGE Nr. 10 din 03-02-2009 privind supravegherea de stat a sănătăţii publice"

October-December: from 1 October, public health emergency ("stare de urgenţă în sănătate publică în") in designated “high-risk” districts (US embassy) and emergency measures on a national level (National public health emergency was abolished) . It was declared based on Art 55 of "LEGE Nr. 10 din 03-02-2009 privind supravegherea de stat a sănătăţii publice". Since the legal instrument changed from 2 ("Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework
that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency") to 4 ("Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe."), emlaw for July-September and October-December is coded separately.

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The Mongolian constitution has a state of emergency clause that has not been used. Instead, Mongolia initially took a string of emergency measures (border closure, school closure etc.) without any such state of emergency, and have later passed the Law on Covid-19 Prevention. This law authorizes the government to "take necessary measures, such as calling quarantine and traffic movement and time limits, as well as approving relevant regimes, procedures, and instructions to be followed during the COVID 19 pandemic.". This is therefore coded as 4.

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was first declared on March 30, via the Presidential Decree nº 11/2020, and it was extended three times, until July 29. According to the constitution, a state of emergency can be declared for up to thirty days a time and it can be extended a maximum of three times. Since legally it could no longer be extended, President Filipe Nyus opted to declare a new state of emergency for thirty days starting from August 8, via the Presidential Decree nº 23/2020. The parliament approved the decree, but the opposition criticized the decision, which they considered unconstitutional since the state of emergency had already been extended the three times allowed by the constitution. After the first thirty days ended, the second state of emergency was not extended and, instead, a state of Public Calamity was implemented via Decree nº 79/2020.

*Comments*:
 Namibia declared a state of emergency on March 17 2020 through the Proclamation 7/2020 (GG 7148) ''The Declaration of State of Emergency: National Disaster (COVID19)'', pursuant to Article 26(1) of the Namibian Constitution and to section 30(3) of the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2012 (Act No. 10 of 2012) (1, 2). This Proclamation was approved by the National Assembly as required by Article 26 of the Namibian Constitution on March 20 2020, which also extended the state of emergency for 6 months.

After the expiration of the state of emergency on 17 September 2020, the government did not extend it further. Instead, the authorities used the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015 to deal with Covid-19 regulations. The Act was brought into force on 17 September 2020 by GN 230/2020 (GG 7338). Regulations are still being updated based on this legal instrument, and are currently in place through January 25 2021 (see 3, 4). Such regulations include the wearing of masks, gatherings, resumption of businesses, prohibition relating to entry into Namibia, quarantine and Covid-19 testing and public transport.

*Comments*:
 Nepal never declared a state of emergency. The relevant legal document in this case has been the Infectious Disease Control Act 1964. Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take necessary action and issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons to root out or prevent the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary.

*Comments*:
 March-June, July-September: The Netherlands has a State of Emergency Act in their constitution (Article 103), but this has not been used. Instead, they have used a mixed set of policies and legal instruments to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. The main emergency measures have been taken under the Safety Regions Act (Wet Veiligheidregions), which allows 25 "safety regions" to enforce a number of emergency measures given that the there's a significant public health threat, which in turn is regulated in the  Public Health Act. 
While the government coordinates a substantial amount of the emergency responses (the measures taken by the regions is more or less identical), the implementation and decision making lies at the regional level. Therefore, this is coded as 6 - no national-level emergency response - since the main legal instrument puts decision making and implementation at the regional level.

October-December: From 1 December, regional emergency ordinances were replaced by a national "Emergency Act on measures against COVID-19" (Tijdelijke wet maatregelen covid-19).

*Comments*:
 Niger declared a nationwide state of emergency through a decree. 
It is often referred to as a State of Public Health Emergency, mainly due to the fact that Niger, and the rest of Sahel region, are under a state of emergency due to security reasons. 
However, the constitution does not differentiate between a state of emergency and a state of health emergency, but instead has provisions only for a state of emergency (therefore coded as 1).

 Nigeria has called upon emergency powers to deal with COVID-19 without, however, having declared a state of emergency. The extant Infectious Diseases Law - the Quarantine Act 1926 - gives the President sweeping powers towards preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases' and to make regulations for associated purposes.

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and July 2020 and the anti-epidemic headquarters was established around the country. It's borders were shut in late January and quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. 

North Korea claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. While this is highly unlikely, there hasn't been a need for additional emergency responses. 

A three-week lockdown was imposed in the city of Kaesong in July 2020 after a suspected case of Covid-19. No information was released to say if it had been a confirmed case of a false alarm. There has been no additional information on the state of emergency in North Korea. 

However as there has not been adequate info on the details of the emergency and the instruments used to declare this emergency, I have coded all time periods as 6.

 March-June: The government declared a state of emergency on 18 March, initially for 30 days (Decision 08-526/2). On 15 May, it was extended by 14 days (Decision 08-682/2). It was then extended by another 14 days on 30 May (Decision 08-729/2), and ended on 13 June. On 15 June, the state of emergency was declared for 8 days to prepare for parliamentary elections (Decision 08-777/3). According to Decision 08-777/3, the state of emergency is declared for holding parliamentary elections with public health measures due to covid-19; since it is declared with reference to covid-19, it is considered part of emergency measures.

July-September:  the primary legal instrument for this time period is "Zakon za zaštita na naselenieto od zarazni bolesti" (Law on Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases). This legal instrument gives the government authority to implement emergency measures.

October-December: State of crisis (kriznata sostojba) was declared by the government on 20 November 2020 based on the Crisis Management Law ("Zakon za upravuvanje so krizi"). The legal instrument gives the Crisis Management Center the authority to implement emergency measures.

*Comments*:
 March-June: Norway passed a new law, the Corona Act, on 24 March, which "gives the King (i.e. the Government) the authority to add to or depart from certain legislation as far as is necessary to safeguard the intention of the law. " In other words, no state of emergency has been declared, but national emergency measures are being taken under the Corona Act. Therefore, this is coded as 4.

July-September, October-December:  In addition to measures passed under the Corona Act, Norway has other implemented emergency measures based on "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases), first used to adopt quarantine measures for people arriving from abroad as "Vedtak etter lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer § 4-1 andre ledd om karantene (isolering) etter reiser utenfor Norden" (13 March 2020, FOR-2020-03-12-271) . In July-September, October-December, emergency measures were passed as amendments to  "Forskrift om smitteverntiltak mv. ved koronautbruddet (covid-19-forskriften)" from 27 March 2020 (FOR-2020-03-27-470).

*Comments*:
 There were several emergency measures taken by the government in response to the covid-19 pandemic. The Resolución de Gabinete N° 11 declared a state of national emergency on March 13. However, it is not based on the constitution, that forsees a "state of urgency" in which the government could suspend constitutional guarantees. Rather, it is based on the public procurement law, which facilitates the purchase of good and services to deal with an emergency situation and provides the government with an emergency fund. Thus, I consider that the measure that most closely resembles a state of exception was the Executive Decree nº 507, from March 24, that declares a complete lockdown and defines other emergency measures.

*Comments*:
 A national state of calamity was declared across the Philippines on 16 March 2020. This was planned to stay  in effect for six months. On 23 March 2020, President Duterte enacted the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. This "authorizes the president to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to Covid-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress. The act would allow President Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost 275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated 438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to "temporarily take over or direct the operations" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities "when the public interest so requires" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and "facilitate and streamline" the accreditation of testing kits. 

2: A COVID-19 law that went into effect on March 24 grants the administration broad powers to address the coronavirus, which has contributed to violations of human rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, access to information, and children's rights.

3: The national state of calamity was extended by a year to September 2021 on 22 September 2020.

 The government of the Republic of the Congo declared a "state of health emergency" on March 28th (to enter into force from March 31) 2020 through a presidential decree. 

Constitution (2015), articles 93, 157 (provisions on state of emergency). Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency,despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if the allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. ''state of siege'') as warranted.

The Constitution is considered the primary legal instrument because it most closely resembles a state of exception.

July-September, October-December: State of alert declared on 18 May based on multiple legal instruments where  Law 55/2020 is considered the primary legal instrument since it most closely resembles a state of exception. Law 55/2020 was passed by the parliament on 15 May 2020 and has regulated the state of alert.

# Russia 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Russia used the Constitution (Article 80) to implement a "DECREE ON MEASURES TO ENSURE SANITARY-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF RUSSIAN POPULATION" that used for all time periods on a federal level. The decree ordered the first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin. The decree also delegates the declaration and implementation of emergency measures to the heads of regional authorities.
 
Note that most emergency measures were taken at the regional level. For example, a state of high alert was announced by all Russia's regions (see references to regional decisions on consultant.ru source), so it was de facto declared in the whole country, but not on a federal level (and therefore is not coded).

*Comments*:
 The Saudi government have taken many emergency measures, such as curfews, lockdowns of some areas and regions, travel bans, border closure and closing of religious and public places.
However, this has been without any declared state of emergency, and there's no reference to specific legal instruments under which these actions are taken in the source, nor that they have adopted any new laws. This lack of legal instrument has also remained in the second period.
This is therefore coded as 5.

 The Senegalese President, Macky Sall, announced on March 23 2020 that, ''in accordance with article 69 of the Constitution and Law 69-29 of 29 April 1969, as of midnight tonight, I am declaring a state of emergency.''
After the state of emergency was lifted on June 30, the Senegalese government took various measures such as the mandatory wearing of face masks based on the Constitution and the powers related to the minister of Interior (see 7, 8).

*Comments*:
 March-June: A presidential decree 1186/2020, published in Official Gazette 29, declaring a state of emergency from 15 March 2020. 

On 7 July, the President announced "as of tomorrow all public gatherings in Belgrade will be banned and that a curfew will be introduced from Friday until Monday", which he later announced would not be possible without declaring another state of emergency. The announcement triggered large anti-lockdown protests, and the measures were not implemented. On 17 July, new restrictive measures were introduced (prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people, making wearing masks and practicing physical distancing mandatory).

July-September, October-December: after the state of emergency ended, emergency measures have been implemented based on  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti" (Law on Protection of the Population from Infectious Diseases) and "Zakon o Vladi" (Law on Government).  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti"  is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles "a state of exception" (Art 6. gives the government authority to declare and implement emergency measures related to infectious diseases). The legal instrument was used to declare "UREDBU o merama za sprečavanje i suzbijanje zarazne bolesti COVID-19" ("REGULATION on measures for prevention and control of infectious diseases COVID-19") (among other decrees) that has been amended several times in both time periods.

*Comments*:
 March-June: State of emergency ("Núdzový stav") declared on 16 March by the government (Order 114/2020) on the basis of Art. 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 227/2002. Constitutional Law No. 227/2002 distinguishes between two types of states of emergency:  "Núdzový stav" (Art.5, includes pandemics) and "Výnimočný stav" (Art 4, only in response to terrorism or widespread violence).  

Note that most sources (media, ICNL) refer to the measures as "state of emergency", with the exception of OSCE report that refers to the measures as "emergency situation."  Using "emergency situation" to refer to the state of emergency (declared from 16 March until 13 June 2020) can be problematic. 

July-September: "Emergency situation" ("Mimoriadna situácia") (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights refers to it as "the state of crisis") was declared from 12 March 2020 based on "Zákon Národnej rady Slovenskej republiky o civilnej ochrane obyvateľstva" (paragraph 8) and has continued during and after the state of emergency ("Núdzový stav").

October-December: State of emergency ("Núdzový stav") declared on 1 October  Art. 5 of the Constitutional Law No. 227/2002 (same legal instrument as in March-June).

# Slovenia 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The main emergency measures were declared under the Communicable Diseases Act Declaration (Zakon o nalezljivih boleznih (ZNB)). Part of the measures was a declaration of "epidemic" from 12 March 2020 until 15 May 2020, and from 18 October (was extended until 18 December 2020 and is in place at the time of coding). Since the declaration of "epidemic"  does not give the government additional powers, ZNB is considered the primary legal instrument. According to OSCE report (p.26), Slovenia (among other countries) "declared some form of special public-health related status, not amounting to a "state of emergency", based on existing or newly adopted primary legislation, and not the constitution" (in this case, it is existing legislation). Since emergency measures based on the ZNB were passed in all time periods (March-June, July-September, October-December), it is coded as the primary legal instrument in all time periods.

According to Democracy Reporting (report from 27 July), "The 1991 Constitution envisages the option for the National Assembly (or, if the Assembly cannot meet, the President of the Republic) to declare a state of emergency when a great and general danger
threatens the existence of the state (Article 92). Importantly, when the state of emergency has been declared, most of the constitutional rights can be temporarily suspended. However, at no point during the epidemic was a state of emergency declared. Severe limitations of the constitutional rights were thus enacted on the basis of existing legislation, namely the Communicable Diseases Act (ZNB). The powers vested in the executive branch by the ZNB are inadequate for an epidemic of this scale and a strict reading of the relevant clauses of the ZNB cannot support measures as drastic as the ones that Slovenia saw between mid-March and early May 2020."

*Comments*:
 On March 16, the Somali government established an emergency task force comprised of Government Line Ministries, Donors, UN agencies and NGOs. The Somali health authorities are exercising heightened public health vigilance to prevent further importation and local transmission and as such have put in place several recommended public health measures. No legal instrument is referred to.

According to Garda, "As of Dec. 4, authorities in Somalia continue to maintain measures and restrictions put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)," with no reference to the legal instrument. Emlaw is therefore coded as 5 for all time periods.

*Comments*:
 March-June: The government proposed an amendment to the Comunicable Disease Act (Temporary authorisations in the Communicable Diseases Act due to the virus causing covid-19) that parliament passed, which allows the government to impose temporary restrictions on gatherings and temporary closing of schools, business, public places and transport. This is thus a new regulation that gives government capacity for some emergency measures related to Covid-19, and is therefore coded as 4. Although the limitation on public gatherings based on the Public Order Act also applied during this period, the amendment to the Comunicable Disease Act is considered the primary legal instrument since it most resembles a "state of exception".

July-September, October-December: Based on the Public Order Act (Ordningslag [1993:1617]) (existing legislation), the government prohibited public gatherings of more than 500 people from March 12 (Ordinance 2020: 114), which was amended on 29 March (prohibiting public gatherings of more than 50 people) and on 24 November  (prohibiting public gatherings of more than 8 people).

# Switzerland 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1, 2 and 3) on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19)). The regulations enacted by Switzerland’s Federal Council were based on the emergency powers provision of Article 185(3) of the Federal Constitution (1) (which authorizes it to “issue ordinances and rulings in order to counter existing or imminent threats of serious disruption to public order or internal or external security” for a limited duration) and on Article 7 of the Epidemics Act of 28 September 2012 (2) (which allows the Federal Council to “order necessary measures for all or part of the country” if an “extraordinary situation requires it,” restricting the cantons to acting in areas outside the scope of the federal order). 

However, since it is a new legislation, it is therefore coded as 4. 

The first Ordinance was imposed on February 28, the second on March 13 (expired on 22 June 2020), and the third on June 22 (in force through December 31, 2021). The second regulation contained and allowed farther reaching emergency measures compared to the first, and under which the main response such as closing of shools and public places and curfews were taken. It is therefore the one used as a start date.

Ordinance 2 was repealed and replaced by COVID-19 Ordinance 3 of June 22 (in force through December 31, 2020), which has fewer restrictions than Ordinance 2. It continues to restrict border crossings and entry by foreign nationals, maintains provisions intended to ensure supplies of essential medical goods, and provides for federal funding of SARS-CoV-2 tests.

In addition, the Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on  25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers “only to the extent that they are required to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic.” The Federal Covid-19 Act  expires on 31 December 2022.

*Comments*:
 Taiwan never went into a state of emergency.

The Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens was passed in Taiwan's legislative Yuan on 25 Feb 2020. It authorizes government expenditure on relief compensation and economic stimulus in fighting the current Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to providing economic relief, the Special Act prescribes penalties for price gouging, carriers or suspected carriers endangering others, misinformation and violation of isolation or quarantine orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

At the same time, most of the government's actions have been authorized under the previously adopted legislation in particular the Communicable Disease Control Act 
and the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, rather than the Special Act. Hence, this has been coded as 2.

 Presidential decree 1544 on socio-economic measures for mitigating the consequences of covid-19 from 5 June 2020 that introduced emergency measures based on the Constitution. Earlier the authorities announced the ban on exit and entry of foreign nationals (12 April 2020) and restrictions on mass events (25 April 2020). According to OECD, emergency measures in Tajikistan are: "Closure of borders and international airspace; Regulations on food markets and price controls; Ban on key food exports; Requirement to wear masks; Closure of schools; Restrictions on mass events." From 15 June, restrictions were eased and "malls, bazaars, restaurants, and hotels are permitted to reopen amid the easing of selected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions. Mosques, transit facilities, and state borders will however remain closed until further notice." (Garda 15 June 2020). According to the UN (12 November 2020), " No changes have been introduced to existing public health measures, which are limited to compulsory “mask regime” and social distancing in public places, as well as a ban for mass gatherings."

# Togo 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The president of Togo declared a three-month nationwide "health emergency,"on April 1, and a six-month period of exceptional lawmaking authority under Article 86 (and 94) of the Constitution. (1)
Before the president's declaration, on March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of April 1, 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.

Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 5, 6), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly ssee link 6), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution.
Coded as 1 instread of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Turkey 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 4

 
*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 Although the Turkish Constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. 
Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued circulars and decrees based on ordinary laws - Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 (2) allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. 

''The Law on the Protection of Public Health authorizes Public Health Councils in all provinces to take necessary measures for removing threats against public health and assisting the execution of measures taken against a pandemic. According to the same law, under specific pandemics, infected patients can be kept in quarantine, travellers may be medically examined, and public places effected by pandemic may be closed down and evacuated. 
The Law on Provincial Administration stipulates that a governor of a province is responsible and authorized for taking necessary measures to provide peace, security, and public well-being; these measures include prohibiting certain people from entering or exiting certain places.'' (1) 

However, ''instead of presidential decrees, all measures in Turkey were taken with administrative decisions generally in the form of presidential or ministerial circulars (legally atypical regulatory acts are almost at the bottom of the hierarchy of norms, and they cannot be contrary to laws and regulations. Typically, circulars are issued only for clarifying provisions of laws and regulations.)
None of the decisions except one declared directly by the Presidency were published in the Official Gazette and most legal professionals, let alone ordinary citizens, would have a difficult time finding the original texts of these circulars and decisions.''

The first significant legal measure undertaken was the closure of all schools and universities. While the authority for closing down schools due to a pandemic is subject to the Law on the State of Emergency, the Ministry of National Education declared that it was decided to have an early holiday for a week and transition to distance learning starting from March 23rd. This decision was never published in the Official Gazette but immediately executed. 
The strictest measures affecting daily life in Turkey have been those taken by the Ministry of Interior. Citing the powers mentioned above conferred by the Law on the Protection of Public Health and the Law on Provincial Administration, the Ministry of Interior in its ministerial circular on March 21 2020 declared a curfew for individuals who are sixty-five years or older, and anyone with a chronic illness, a measure that was executed nationwide as provincial Public Health Councils adopted identical decisions for curfew.
''The measures introduced in this period require a solid normative base which may either be the state of emergency or  new laws adopted by the Parliament for directly addressing the situation otherwise in the long term the possibility of arbitrariness may be as destructive as the pandemic itself.''

*Comments*:
 Turkmenistan has not confirmed any Covid-19 cases. Among many reports that express concern about the situation (see links to Human Rights Watch articles), the U.S. embassy issued the following alert : “While there are no official reports of positive COVID-19 cases in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Embassy has received reports of local citizens with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 undergoing COVID-19 testing and being placed in quarantine in infectious diseases hospitals for up to fourteen days”, which was dismissed by the authorities as "fake news" (Reuters 23 June 2020).  On 13 July 2020, the authorities issues orders to wear face masks because of high concentration of dust in the air (as reported in state media). According to Garda, "the government has also advised individuals to use personal protective equipment (PPE), to maintain a social distance of at least 1m (3ft) apart when in public, and to avoid standing near air conditioners after spending time outside." According to OECD, the emergency measures in Turkmenistan are "Closure of borders, Restrictions on internal movements of people and goods" and "Despite the government claiming that there are no cases of COVID-19 in the country, a range of containment measures designed to restrict the movement of people and goods were implemented in early summer and remain in place as of October 2020." According to OSCE report (p. 26), the emergency measures are "screening and quarantine measures, temporary closure of passenger traffic, physical distancing, closure of cafes, restaurants and entertainment centers".

Note that non-government controlled areas are not considered in the coding. Emergency situation ended on 24 April 2020.

July-September, October-December: the legal instrument in these time periods is ZAKON UKRAYINY Pro zakhyst naselennya vid infektsiynykh khvorob ("Law of Ukraine On Protection of Population against Infectious Diseases") that was used to declare quarantine from 12 March 2020 (Decision 211) and that has been amended several times (e.g. decision 392 extending quarantine until 31 July, decision 641 extending quarantine until 31 December 2020).

*Time period: Q2*: 4

*Time period: Q4*: 4

 

*Comments*:
 The UK governmet has enacted two new sets of regulations, the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020, and the Coronavirus Act. Both enable several emergency measures related to Covid-19. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) is here counted as the main legislation, as it provides the main limitations on freedom of movement, gathering and the closing of public places and business. Noteworthy is also that there are four separate such regulations for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the regulations are very similar and provides the same emergency measures capacity across the UK.
This is a new law, and not a state of emergency declaration, and is therefore coded as 4.

Note that The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was repealed on July 3 and replaced with The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/684), which relaxed some emergency measures. It is still the initial one that counts as the primary legal instrument here, which has ended, but there is thus still emergency legislation in place in the UK. Under the no. 2 Regulations 2020 of 4 July 2020, more measures were added increasingly to stem the spread of covid 19 between July and September 2020. 

Between October 14 -  November 4 2020, the first COVID-19 tier regulations was introduced, which categorized each local authority area under one of three levels of restrictions. This was revoked on November 5 and replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200), which enforced the nationwide second lockdown regulations (in effect until 1 December 2020).

On 2 December the UK government replaced  SI 1200 of November 5 with 2020 SI 2020/1374 which reintroduced a countrywide three-tier legal framework.  These Regulations expire at the end of 2nd February 2021. 

All the aforementioned Regulations were introduced under the same legal instrument, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.
