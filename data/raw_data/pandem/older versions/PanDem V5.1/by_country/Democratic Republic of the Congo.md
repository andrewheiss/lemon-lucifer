## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The Head of State HE Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo decreed by ordinance (n° 20/014 du 24 mars 2020) (2) this Tuesday March 24, 2020 the state of health emergency to face the pandemic of Coronavirus in the Democratic Republic of Congo.''
The Constitution (2005): articles 85, 86, 144, 145 (provisions on a state of emergency). 
Coded as 1 instead of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.
After the lifting of the state of emergency, there are social distancing measures in place, and the mandatory wearing of face masks, but these do not seem to have been taken under a specific legal instrument.

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

*Comments*:
 The Constitution (art 85, 86, 143, 144) and the Ordinance No. 17/024 of July 10, 2017 (art 63, 64) require the approval of the declaration of the state of emergency (actually its extension beyond the 30-day initial limit) by the Senate and the National Assembly, as well as a confirmation of the constitunality of the act by the Constitutional Court. 

''The ordinance proclaiming the state of emergency or the state of siege ceases to have effect after the expiration of the period provided for in the Constitution, unless the National Assembly and the Senate, seized by the President of the Republic by decision of the Council of Ministers, did not authorize its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.''

Article 85 When grave circumstances threaten, in an immediate manner, the independence or the integrity of the national territory or when they provoke the disruption of the regular functioning of the institutions, the President of the Republic proclaims a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145 of this
Constitution.

Article 86 
The President of the Republic declares war by ordinance deliberated in the Council
of Ministers after the opinion of the Superior Council of Defense and the
authorization of the National Assembly and of the Senate, in accordance with Article
143 of this Constitution.

Article 144
In application of the provisions of Article 85 of this Constitution, the state of siege,
like the state of urgency, is declared by the President of the Republic.
The National Assembly and the Senate then convene of right. If they are not in
session, an extraordinary session is convoked to this effect in accordance with
Article 116 of this Constitution.
The closing of the ordinary or extraordinary sessions is[,] of right[,] delayed to
permit, as the case may be, the application of the provisions of the preceding
paragraph.
The state of urgency or the state of siege may be proclaimed for all or part of the
territory of the Republic for a time period of thirty days.
The ordinance proclaiming the state of urgency or the state of siege ceases[,] of
right[,] to produce its effects after the expiration of the time period specified in the
[fourth] paragraph of this article, unless the National Assembly and the Senate,
referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic on decision of the Council
of Ministers, have authorized its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.
The National Assembly and the Senate can, by way of a law, end at any moment the
state of urgency or the state of siege.

Article 145
In case of a state of urgency or of state of siege, the President of the Republic takes,
by ordinances deliberated in the Council of Ministers, the measures necessary to
respond to the situation.
These ordinances are, on their signature, submitted to the Constitutional Court
which, ceasing other matters, declares if they derogate or not from this Constitution.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

 
*Time period: Q2*: 4

 
*Time period: Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: Q4*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 The Senate and National Assembly of the DRC decided on March 18 to suspend all sessions for the month of March due to COVID-19 (until April 5).The regular session opened on 16 March, but all legislative activities were suspended from 18 March to 05 April due to Covid-19. Since then, the legislature has resumed with special rules of procedure for social distancing. While the legislature must approve the state of emergency, this gives powers to the executive to rule by decree "the measures necessary to respond to the situation" using ordinances deliberated through the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the National Assembly, however, may challenge the government and consider motions of no confidence or censorship.
The state of emergency was lifted on July 22.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3)

 The Democratic Republic of the Congo announced a state of emergency on March 25, which was accompanied by: closure of the country's external borders (except freight); ban on gatherings; confinement of the commune of Gombe in the provincial capital Kinshasa (movement prohibited except provided with a badge issued by the authorities); obligation to wear a mask in the capital Kinshasa, even handcrafted. 
In the provinces, restrictive measures were also taken to limit the movement of people (excluding goods): quarantine of Lubumbashi, Goma, Beni, Butembo and Bukavu; curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in Lualaba province and the city of Lubumbashi; closures of air access (Tanganyika, Tshopo), port (South Kivu), or land (North Kivu / South Kivu, Ituri / Beni territory in North Kivu, Tshopo).

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The medical information and protective guidlines of DRC government on covid19 are similar to WHO (see 3,4,5,6), but the government has been insisting on using and producing hydroxychloroquine:

''In March President Felix Tshisekedi declared that it was "urgent" to produce chloroquine "in industrial quantities"'' (1,2).
''In June, The Democratic Republic of the Congo launched the 200mg antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine on the local market, in order to use it in the treatment of the new coronavirus, Covid-19. A laboratory has also been set up in South Kivu in the east of the country to locally produce the national needs for this drug.'' (7)
There is no info found on whether the government continues using chloroquine after June.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 Days after Congo announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On March 29, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On March 30, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''On Tuesday, June 9, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
