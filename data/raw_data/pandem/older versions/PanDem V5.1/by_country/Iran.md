## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Iran has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 79), but this has not been activated. They have implemented several emergency measures, such as curfews, school closings, closing religious and public places and so on, but this has not been in reference to any such legal instrument. Likewise, the reentrance of several measures during October and November had no references to legal instruments as far as have been found. This is therefore coded as 5, Iran has a national level emergency response but without any specific legal instrument for those emergency measures.

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 The Iranian Parliament's law making role has not been affected by the emergency measures taken by Iran, according to the IPU. Parlamentarians have primarily worked remotely, but they have for example worked with the government to pass financial aid packages during the pandemic. And no other indications have been found that the Iranian parliament has been restricted in its power or law making role during the pandemic (beyond the already existing restrictions where several formal and informal powers can monitor and veto the parliament's actions, but this is not related to Covid-19 or the emergency measures). No information has been found indicating that Iran's parliament has been limited in any such way by emergency measures under the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods either. This is therefore coded as 0.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

## Legislature resumption date (*legresdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 0

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 In the Mar-Jun period, Iran's emergency measures have been implemented nationwide by the government, and no sub-national variation in these measures have been found. This is therefore coded as 0 for this period. In the Jul-Sep period, a little sub-national variation was introduced in that lockdown measures were reintroduced in Tehran on July 15 due to a rise in Covid-19 cases. This period is therefore coded as 1. Finally, in the Oct-Dec period, more sub-national variation has emerged as new restrictions came in place in 25 of the 31 regions, as well as imposing new curfews in 31 cities, including Tehran. For this period, this is therefore coded 2.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have not reported any discrimination within the response to Covid-19, and no other indications of such discrimination has been found for any of the periods.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 There are several reports from April on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests. However, this violence was not part of an emergency response. This is therefore coded 0.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Comments*:
 Reporters without borders report that: "The Covid-19 National Management Office (the government body set up to combat the coronavirus) and the press department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance have issued a communiqué announcing that "no newspapers will be printed until further notice." Officially, this is to ensure respect for the government's social distancing measures, because 'the distribution of printed newspapers and magazines requires physical interaction between individuals, journalists, printers and distributers, and this interaction could potentially facilitate the spread of the virus.'". This is thus a part of the national emergency response, and a de jure limitation on the media by banning all printed media. However, as it does not hinder them from publishing news online, it does not count as a major de jure limitation, and is therefore coded as 1.
No evidence has been found that this ban has been revoked, and it is thus assumed to be continuing.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 There are several reports on journalists being arrested for reporting on the coronavirus, especially those who have published evidence that contradicts the governments figures about the spread of the virus and accused the Iranian government of misinformation about the Covid-19 situation in Iran. These Journalists have generally been accused of "Publishing false information about the coronavirus".  A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce. In addition, the media in Iran is severely restricted in several ways and journalists are arrested and jailed for numerous reasons, generally limiting the capacity for reporting, including on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes.

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Through Irans ban on printed media, they have halted the reporting on non-covid-19 related news as well with reference to Covid-19. While the news outlets are allowed to publish online, it is still a de facto infringement of media reporting on non-covid-19 related news. A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce.. This is therefore coded as 1.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

*Time period: Q3*: 2

 
*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 The Iranian government have repeatedly been covering up or denying access to covid-19 related information, and undermining reporting on the Covid-19 situation in Iran. While reports mainly pertain to the first period, the reports that Iran are covering up actual number of cases and deaths, and not granting access to information on Covid-19-related information in Iran, is ongoing. For example, a newspaper was shut down by the government for it publishing an interview with a member of the Iranian Covid-19 Taskforce who spoke of Iran covering up how many cases that was actually recorded in the country. Furthermore, no evidence has been found indicating that the situation has improved in the Oct-Dec period. This is therefore coded as 2.

## Verbal harassment of journalists (*mevhar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government or its agents verbally harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have verbally harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 There are several reports on journalists being threatened and harassed by government over making inquiries into the Covid-19 situation and the government response. While such reports have only been found for the first period, no indication has been given that things have improved for journalists in the latter periods, and this is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

## Physical harassment of journalists (*mephar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the government or its agents physically harassed journalists reporting about Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the whether the government and/or its agents have physically harassed journalists who report on the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Several journalists have been arrested and detained due to reporting on Covid-19 in Iran. Many of these (if not all) are still detained it seems, clearly constituting a physical harassment for their reporting in relation to Covid-19 in the following periods as well. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods, although no evidence has been found of any further assaults or detentions for reporting on Covid-19 in the Jul-Sep and Oct-Dec periods.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 0

 
*Time period: Q3*: 0

 
*Time period: Q4*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There is no important deviations from the information provided by WHO and that of the Iranian health department  on Covid-19, and no complaints or accusations of any such disinformation has been found. There are however numerous and ongoing accusations of Iran underreporting the number of cases in the country, but this is not included in this question.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 2

 
*Time period: Q3*: 0

 
*Time period: Q4*: 0

 

*Comments*:
 There are several reports on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Lethal violence occurred at the hands of security forces in reaction to inmates not following the regulations and protesting on Covid-19 related issues, and Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests. This is therefore coded as 2 for the Mar-Jun period. However, no reports have been found on other such violence or abuse in enforcing covid-19 restrictions. As the incidents in prisons by all reports seem to be isolated to the first period, and not a continued practice, it is thus only coded 2 for the first period and 0 for the latter two periods. Note also that there are on-going reports of police violence in Iran, but as far as have been seen these are not connected to nor have been legitimized by the covid-19 restrictions.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1) 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The Iranian military is in charge of much of the emergency measures in terms of planning and logistics. Furthermore, in March, the military was deployed to enforce restrictions and clear public places, close down businesses etc. It is unclear how involved the military has been since then in enforcing Covid-19 regulations, but no evidence has been found showing that the military presence has been retracted, and it is thus assumed that they are still taking part in the enforcement. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.
