## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 rime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (4). The official notice of the state of emergency was not gazetted until 27 March, in which it was stated to be made retroactive until 18 March (2). Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (3). As such, the state of emergency would have been set to expire on 31 March 2020. According to some interpretations - the 14 day period begins with the gazette notice and thus would have ended 08 April 2020 (5). Meanwhile, on 25 March, the Prime Minister issued  a nation-wide curfew in effect from 29 March to 29 April (6).

On 15 April 2020, Prime Minister Thabane issued another declaration of a state of emergency until 28 April (7). Meanwhile, the emergency restrictions from the first declaration had remained in effect, despite being expired. 

On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (8,9). On 22 April, the Prime Minister announced an extension of the nationwide lockdown under the state of emergency and Public Health Act of 1970. These measures would remain in place until 05 May 2020 (10). 

On 28 April 2020, the National Assembly of Lesotho refused to approve a six-month extension of the state of emergency, citing concerns that it could be used for political gain and encouraging the government to instead use the state of national disaster (12).

On 06 May 2020, the Prime Minister issued a decree lifting the nationwide lockdown, but keeping in place several other restrictions through 19 May 2020. This decree includes reference to "the disaster induced state of emergency declared ... under section 3 and 15 of the Disaster Management Act, 1997" (11). No other document formally declaring such a state of disaster was located - but based on this we are left to assume that such a state of disaster was declared after Parliament refused to extend the state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (15). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (13). On 29 October, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months (until 29 April 2021). This also aligns with the initial decree being for 6 months (14).

## Emergency response name (*emname*) 

*Question*: What is the specific name of the legal instrument that the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers  to  the  legal  instrument  defined  in emlaw.   This  may  be  the Constitution,  law,  executive  order,  or  other  legal  mechanism.  Give  the  specific  proper name of the law as it is known in the country.  This can be in the country’s language or a translation if such is readily used and available. If the legal instrument is the Constitution, also provide the Article or section number wherever possible.

 

*Scale*: Character string.

 
*Time period: Q2*: Constitution (1993), section 23 (1)

 
*Time period: Q3*: Disaster Management Act of 1997

 
*Time period: Q4*: Disaster Management Act of 1997

 

*Comments*:
 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution on 18 March (1) and again on 15 April (3). On 29 April, the Prime Minister further declared a state of disaster under the Disaster Management Act 1997, with effect from 29 April to 28 October (4,5). The state of disaster was extended from 29 October to 29 April (6). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency.

Because the state of disaster begins as the state of emergency ends, we do not code the emergency measures as ending despite a change in legal instrument mid-quarter.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (2). On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (3,4). It immediately reinstated the parliament. Therefore - for the Mar-Jun period, we code the legislature as having been dissolved (4) because it was unable to function for part of the coding period. Media sources indicate that when legislators arrived after the prorogue decree - police escorted them from the assembly (6). 

Under the Disaster Management Act 1997 - the government has a list of specified emergency powers that are narrowly defined to the disaster itself (5).

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

*Comments*:
 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (2). On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (3,4). It immediately reinstated the parliament.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 In the state of emergency declared from 18 March, it stated that "members of the press shall refrain from publishing 'fake news'". The determination of 'fake news' remains undefined (1). A copy of Legal Notice 37 which reinstated the state of emergency on 15 April could not be located online - therefore the coding is conservative to assume that it contained the same restrictions, as this acted as an extension of the prior state of emergency without legislative approval (legislature was dissolved) (2). Likewise, a copy of Legal Notice 40 of 2020 could not be located - however, Legal Notice 41 and 68 on Public Health (COVID-19) Regulations 2020 states that "no person shall publish or spread false information" under section 12(6) (3,4). We code this conservatively, assuming that the Public Health (COVID-19) Regulations 2020 reissued in October 2020 also contain the same regulation (unable to locate a this time).

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3)

*Comments*:
 After the government introduced initial lockdown measures in March/April 2020, several reports surfaced on social media about police brutality in enforcing the measures. Videos showed police "making citizens roll on the ground and beating them up" (1). The assistant commissioner of police issued a directive ordering police to desist such violations. No subsequent incidents related to Covid-19 are found, although there are other occasions of police and military brutality in the country during 2020 (2).

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency states "the Lesotho Defence Force and the Lesotho Mounted Police Service shall operationalist all the above measures" (1). Other available declarations for emergency measures do not mention the military's involvement and no media reports of military deploying since April 2020 (2).
