## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The Burkinabe Council declared a state of health alert (2) in accordance with article 66 of the Public Health Code (1) (1994) through a press release on March 26, 2020, with which it also decided to issue a decree ((3) - Decret no 2020- 0215)) establishing:
a) a two-week quarantine (starting on March 27, 2020) in the cities of Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Boromo, Houndé, Dédougou, Banfora, Manga and Zorgho, and  to be extended to any city where a positive COVID-19 case will occur.
b) a two (02) week extension of the closure of all school facilities and activities throughout the national territory. The recovery date is set for April 14, 2020 but could see a rearrangement depending on the evolution of the epidemic.

However, there had been several concerns raised over the legitimation and legal basis of the government's state of health alert (see 4, 5):
a) the state of health alert had not been issued through a decree, nor did it have a limit date (only the separate measures do) (5). 
b) the decree establishing the curfew has no legal basis, since it only vaguely refers to the Constitution, nor the curfew was instituted with reference to  the state of health alert. 
c) critics point to the non-existent source in the public health code of the measures restricting rights and freedoms taken by the authorities within the framework of the state of health alert: the public health code article cited (66) only allows for measures of a sanitary nature (hygiene and prophylaxis), and not for a curfew etc.

Yet, although the government was lacking a clear legal basis for the above measures, and it had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the covid19 package of measures, during the Council of Ministers on April 16 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill for an enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see (8, 9 )). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law. The ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after consulting the Constitutional Council. They come into force as soon as they are published, but become null and void if the ratification bill is not submitted to the National Assembly before the date set by the enabling law. At the end of the period mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the ordinances can only be modified by law in those of their provisions which are in the legislative domain."

The bill on the enabling law providing the government with the legal basis to take urgent covid19 actions within three months was voted on May 5 by the National Assembly (see 10) (Law no 015-2020/AN du 05 mai 2020). There was no evidence found on whether the law was extended after the 3 months limit-period. Measures taken after that are more general in nature, like the mandatory wearing of face masks.

 The state of health alert had no limit date in its issuance, however, In May 5, the Burkinabe National Assembly passed an enabling law allowing the government to rule by Ordinance for a period of 3 months, in order to deal with the pandemic. No evidence was found on whether the government extended this enabling law, and since the curfew ended on June 3, it is assumed that the law did not get prolonged.

Separate measures like the curfew and quarantine have been (partly) lifted since June 3. The resumption of domestic and international flights follows the expiration of a nationwide 2100-0400 health curfew June 3. The wearing of facemasks in public remains mandatory nationwide.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

*Comments*:
 On Monday 16 March, Burkina Faso suspended all parliamentary plenary sessions until April 1. General Committees of under 50 people will continue to meet. All guided visits in parliament are suspended.'' 

''Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have all declared a state of health emergency. This means that governments are allowed to rule by decree or adopt administrative measures with the objective of reducing the spread of COVID-19. During a state of emergency or health emergency governments can adopt measures that temporarily limit individual freedoms, such as freedom of movement (DW 02/04/2020). 

Although the government had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the covid19 response, during the Council of Ministers on April 16 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill on enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see (4, 5, 6)). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law.

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

Domestic air flights resumed on July 24. The wearing of facemasks in public remains mandatory nationwide, and all security-related curfews in areas under a state of emergency will continue.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Burkina Faso started a clinical trial on chloroquine against covid 19 on April 6, to last for one month: 
''Like Morocco and Senegal, which advocate the use of chloroquine, the authorities have announced two clinical trials of this drug on people with COVID-19. However, Roger Nebié, the director general of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique et Technologique (CNRST), told Jeune Afrique on the phone that the first results will have to wait.'' (2)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
