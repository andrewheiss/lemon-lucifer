## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Based on Article 81 of the Moroccan Constitution, in extraordinary cases of necessity and emergency, the government can adopt decrees having the force of law, which are immediately binding on adoption, but require parliamentary approbation.'' On March 23, 2020, the parliament adopted the bills 2.20.292 / 2.20.293 establishing the state of health emergency on the national territory and empowering the government, to take all measures aimed at the containment of COVID-19. The state of health emergency took effect from March 20, 2020.

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

Also, some social distancing measures were taken: ''To limit the risk of infection and observe social distancing while keeping Parliament functioning, the secretaries general of both houses reduced the staff on site to a core group carrying out essential duties, while others are teleworking. A communication and follow-up cell was set up to raise staff awareness of hygiene measures to put in place in parliament.''

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If exact date is unknown, give an approximate date (e.g. first of month if month is known).

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR?

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Comments*:
 With the Decree No. 2-20-292 of March 23 on special provisions for a State of Health Emergency, the government is enabled to ... take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

Also, in a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news (the statement is found in the link in arabic). The Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions starting on Tuesday, May 26.  

In addition, on March 19, 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on April 27, 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on May 4, 2020.

## Media limitations end (*melimend*) 

*Question*: When do the de-jure limits on media freedom end?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Provide the exact date the emergency measures with de-jure limitations on media freedoms (*medialimits*) are set to expire. If the exact date is unknown, give the final day of the month. If there are no de-jure limits on media freedoms (melim=0) or there is no defined end date, leave blank.

*Comments*:
 Two of the government measures that de jure limited media freedom were lifted in May: 
On May 26, the Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions. 

On May 4, the draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks was  temporarily suspended after a large wave of critiques and denouncements.

However, since the state of health emergency is still in place through December 10 2020, it is assumed that so does the government order which states that ''anyone who contravenes the decree No. 2-20-292 that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130). Coding therefore is 1 for the remaining periods after May.

*Comments*:
 Citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28th March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on COVID-19. The situation of those detained and imprisoned are being monitored by rights groups.
Human rights groups have called for the release of those freely expressing their opinion, including the release of journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement to all African countries, including Morocco, where four journalists are imprisoned and called for the release of jailed journalists and to protect the free press and the free flow of information at this crucial time.'' (1)

Also, a Moroccan citizen journalist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was charged on 17 May by the prosecutor of the Court of First Instance in Laayoune with "breaking orders related to the health emergency status",based on the health emergency Decree law passed in March 2020, and with "offending public officials", based on article 263of the penal code. The trial was postponed for the end of September. (2)

In addition, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since November 21. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its COVID-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (3)

 Citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110. On 28th March 2020, the secretary general of the presidency of the public prosecutor's office reported that the police had arrested 450 individuals for breaking the public health emergency law and 56 for publishing false information on COVID-19. The situation of those detained and imprisoned are being monitored by rights groups.
Human rights groups have called for the release of those freely expressing their opinion, including the release of journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) issued a statement to all African countries, including Morocco, where four journalists are imprisoned and called for the release of jailed journalists and to protect the free press and the free flow of information at this crucial time.'' (1)

Also, a Moroccan citizen journalist, Ibrahim Amrikli, was charged on 17 May by the prosecutor of the Court of First Instance in Laayoune with "breaking orders related to the health emergency status",based on the health emergency Decree law passed in March 2020, and with "offending public officials", based on article 263of the penal code. The trial was postponed for the end of September. (2)

In addition, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since November 21. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its COVID-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (3)

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Morocco has been insisting on the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment against covdi19 despite WHO's decision to stop the trial. On May 27, moroccan authorities decided to continue the use of the chloroquine-based treatment protocol. 
The Moroccan Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb ''also returned to the treatment protocol put in place by Morocco and the use of Chloroquine which has “proven itself”.'' (1)

“There are tests and in view of some, it has a certain effectiveness against the entry of the virus into the cell and allows very early on to reduce the viral load and contagion”, he assured. And to add, further, that chloroquine “allows to reduce the viral load from the 5th day and make the patient non-contagious” (1) (September 2020).

 There are incidents of police violence which Moroccan police has denied, but there are also reports that citizens and journalists have been detained in Morocco for expressing their views:  ''According to the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (AMDH), as of March 2020, the number of prisoners detained for legitimately expressing their views across the country reached 110.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.

*Comments*:
 The measures under the state of health emergency ''include a mandatory nationwide lockdown and curfew enforced by the police and the army, requiring that citizens limit their movement during the day to absolutely necessary activities. The government has been strictly enforcing the measure by requiring individuals leaving home to acquire a special permit either from their workplace or local authorities. Since March 20, authorities have arrested thousands of individuals for violating the state of emergency or for spreading false information...''

''The state of emergency allows, if necessary, the use of public force. Thus Morocco has deployed the police and even the army to control derogatory movements. Part of the faithful protested against the closure of the mosques.''
