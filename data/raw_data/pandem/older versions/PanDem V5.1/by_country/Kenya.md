## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 The Kenyan Public Health Act (1) is the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various actions during public health crises, including declaring an infectious disease a “notifiable infectious disease” or a “formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease,” and taking the necessary prevention and suppression measures to fight the disease.  Specific powers accorded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country.'' (2)

Kenyan authorities (MUTAHI KAGWE, the Cabinet Secretary for Health) declared on the Government Gazzette on March 2, 2020 (3):
(a) the coronavirus 2019 disease as a notifiable disease for the purposes of section 17 (1) of the Public Health Act, and 
(b) that the provisions of Part IV of the Public Health Act shall apply with respect to the  prevention, control and suppression of the coronavirus 2019 disease.
This allowed the government to take the necessary measures in order to deal with the covid19 pandemic the same way as other formidable or notifiable diseases that are already included in the Act.

The first activation of the Public Health Act (Sections 35 and 36) to deal with the pandemic occurred on April 3, 2020, with LEGAL NOTICE No . 49 - 
THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020  (4), which has been updated ever since a few times (for the full list of legislation, see 8).

Before that, the Public Order Act (2003) (9) was activated -now the Public Order (State Curfew) Order 2020- effected by Legal Notice No. 36 of the Kenya Gazette Notice of 26th March 2020, imposing the countrywide curfew in Kenya, which was the strictest measure compared to the ones issued previously. (10).

Before March 26, a few other more general measures and guidelines had been issued (see 5, 6, 7).

*Comments*:
 Kenya has introduced a combination of protocols and measures in place. The initial measures were implemented by a Presidential Directive on March 15,  but the legal instruments were activated later. Although the coronavirus disease was declared an infectious disease under the Public Health Act on March 2 (1), the first legal decision taken under this, hence the activation of the PHA, was on April 3 (2). 
However, the Public Order (State Curfew) Order Act that contained the strictest measures (curfew) was introduced earlier, on March 26 (in effect from March 27) (3), emstart is coded according to the latter (Public Order Act (State Curfew) (Order 2020) on March 26th).

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19?

 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the main national-level emergency measures as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.

 1. Yes.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 1

 
*Time period: Q3*: 1

 
*Time period: Q4*: 1

 

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid19 measures were implemented with the Presiential Directive on March 15, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020 - ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS, by the legal notice n.49 on 3rd April 2020, and the PUBLIC ORDER ACT (legal notice n.36, March 26), all with imeediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of COVID-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament’s interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of COVID-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3)

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

The emergency laws allow the president to widely interpret and implement decrees, but only related to the pandemic.

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

*Comments*:
 Kenyan authorities have been accused of abusively and by force putting people with covid 19 symptoms in quarantine in facilities that lacked proper sanitation, were crowded and confined, and did not provide people with personal protective equipment like face masks.

However, no evidence was found based on these democratic rights.

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

## Media limitations start (*melimstart*) 

*Question*: When were the de-jure limits on media freedom first adopted?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Provide the exact date the emergency measures with de-jure limitations on media freedoms (*melim*) were first adopted. If the exact date is unknown, give the first day of the month.

*Comments*:
 This is the date when the order was announced by the Kenyan President during the first package of measures (1). These measures that accompanied the order's announcement were said to have a 30/day limit. Later on, the Public Health Act and the State curfew order were activated in end March - early April, and it is not clear where this specific order fits into. 
However, since the government has been actively attempting to restrict media reporting on covid19, and citizens' freedom of expression about it (see media variables and links 3, 4), it is assumed that it is an ongoing order. The curfew and the emergency measures are in place until January 3 2021.

*Question*: When do the de-jure limits on media freedom end?

 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*)

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law.

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities attempting to de-facto limit reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government preventing media access to information about the coronavirus in general.

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings.'' (1, 2)

''About 60% of these cases were related to lack of access to public information or restricted from accessing various open places to interrogate and provide objective and critical reporting on the Counties COVID-19 preparedness. In 7 cases, government officials unjustifiably denied journalists access to crucial information or interviews as part of their role of interrogating the country’s COVID-19 preparedness.'' (2)

''Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media's job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. ''Trust and obey'' has seemed to be the overriding message.'' (3)

 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities de-facto attempting to limit reporting about the about the coronavirus. Also, the media environment in Kenya faces many challenged and restrictions for journalists.

(1, 2) 

''At least 10 journalists and digital content creators have been arrested or threatened with prosecution under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act 2018. They were accused of publishing and spreading false and alarming information on social media about the new coronavirus. At least 10 others were arrested under the Public Order Act, for allegedly flouting the curfew.'' (1)

''Journalists and media outlets in Kenya faced increased pressure after Uhuru Kenyatta assumed office in 2013. The current administration has continued to enact laws that undermine media freedom. Some of these laws are the Media Act, 2013, Kenya Information, Communication (Amendment) Act, 2013 and Security Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014. These laws imposed tough penalties on journalists and expanded offences for which they could be punished. The government's increased intolerance of the media culminated in the temporary shutdown of four independent TV stations after they covered former opposition chief Raila Odinga's symbolic presidential inauguration in 2017''.

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The information from the Kenyan government largely conforms to WHO guidelines.

While the Kenyan Ministry of Health initially approved a trial use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients and imported 379,000 tablets from India, it did not begin its trials before the WHO issued its advisory against the use of the drug. In response, the Kenyan government suspended its plans to use hydroxychloroquine (1). It has since condemned messages claiming that hydroxychloroquine is a cure (2)

Along with 12 other African countries, Kenya is now participating in the ANTICOV trials led by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), an international non-profit dedicated to finding affordable treatments for diseases (3). The trials began in September and are currently testing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms (4). Because this is a drug trial and not an endorsement by the government, we do not consider it disinformation.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 There are a series of police brutality incidents in Kenya, many with lethal outcomes. 
According to a recent investigation by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), during the first nine weeks of the government's Covid-19 restrictions, police were responsible for killing at least 15 people. IPOA is still investigating the deaths of another 5 individuals, as well as other allegations of robbery, sexual assault, shooting, and general harassment by police while enforcing Covid-19 restrictions. (4)

Since the second wave of lockdown measures were adopted in November 2020, the police have arrested over 1,000 persons for violating bans on public gatherings and curfews. In the process, they have continued to engage in "unprofessional" conduct such as destruction of property, as well as harassment, intimidation, and violence according to a statement by 15 Kenyan civil society groups. (5) 

''Rights group Amnesty International said Kenyan police had killed at least 100 people in 2020, with 21 related to COVID infractions, such as curfew enforcement or mask violations.
At least six people were killed in the first 10 days alone, according to Human Rights Watch. President Kenyatta had cause to apologize for police excesses in one of his coronavirus addresses.'' (3)

''Enforcement of virus containment regulations turned deadly in Lessos, a small town in Kenya's Rift Valley where a witness confirmed that three people were killed during a confrontation between police and residents over the wearing of face masks.'' (June 29) (2)

''According to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), 15 people have been killed by the police (as of June 15) and 31 injured for breaching the curfew. These cases have included:
The beating of a truck driver in Nakuru on 27 March.
On 30 March, a 13 year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, was shot to death by the police as he was standing on the balcony of his parents' home in Nairobi a few minutes after curfew. In June, the IPOA announced that a police officer had been charged with his murder.
On the night of 1 June, a homeless man popularly known as Vaite was shot dead in Mathare (Nairobi) shortly after the curfew.'' (1)

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
