## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce  the  main  national-level  emergency  measures  with  reference  to  Covid-19  since March 11, 2020.  If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a “state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g.  seeAgamben 2005).  Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding.

 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Other legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other.

*Comments*:
 Russia used the Constitution (Article 80) to implement a "DECREE ON MEASURES TO ENSURE SANITARY-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF RUSSIAN POPULATION" that used for all time periods on a federal level. The decree ordered the first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May, and ended on 11 May, as announced by President Putin. The decree also delegates the declaration and implementation of emergency measures to the heads of regional authorities.
 
Note that most emergency measures were taken at the regional level. For example, a state of high alert was announced by all Russia's regions (see references to regional decisions on consultant.ru source), so it was de facto declared in the whole country, but not on a federal level (and therefore is not coded).

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have any of the emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 limited the lawmaking role of the legislature? 

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent. If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. Code this item based on the most severe limitations observed during the time period, even if those limitations have since been lifted.

 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. No,Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the healthcare system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19 or the legislature has been dissolved for some reason other than Covid-19 (e.g. coup d'État).

## Legislature dissolution date (*legdisdate*) 

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, on what date did this occur?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

*Question*: If the national legislature was dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 since 11 March 2020, when did it resumed its functions?

 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. Leave blank if the legislature has been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit=4*) and has not resumed its functions; or it has not been dissolved, suspended, or equivalent with reference to Covid-19 (*leglimit!=4*).  Note that an extended recess during which the legislature continues to exist and/or periods where the plenary is suspended but committees still meet do not count as suspension, dissolution, or equivalent.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level?

 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country.

*Comments*:
 Most measures have been delegated to the regional authorities with some regions taking stronger measures and for a longer period of time. On 2 April, President Putin said that he gave regional authorities additional power to tackle the crisis due to regional differences and all regions declared a state of high alert.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated “solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin” (ICCPR Art 4)?

 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. By de-jure, we mean any official government instrument used to make or enforce the emergency measures, including (but not limited to) laws, decrees, and official pronouncements or directives. By de-facto, we mean the actions taken on the part of the government or its agents in an official capacity regardless of whether those actions were allowed de jure.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination.  
 2. Minor de-jure discrimination. 
 3. Yes, major, systematic de-jure or de-facto discrimination

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

 

*Clarification*: Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable.

*Comments*:
 No measures violating non-derogable rights.  Note that according to OSCE report, "fake news" legislature in countries that implemented such laws (including Russia) can be problematic since "there may well be a legitimate concern about the deliberate and malicious spread of disinformation, such criminal provisions are unlikely to comply with the principle of specificity of criminal law enshrined in Article 15 of the ICCPR and Article 7 of the ECHR due to the inherent vagueness and ambiguity of the term “false information”.

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom?

 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to fact check what is disinformation, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.

*Comments*:
 Based on amendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code from 31 March 2020 (100-FZ), dissemination of "false information" can be punished with a fine or jail sentence, which IPI argues is a "fake news" law that can be used to limit freedom of the media. According to the Council of Europe, "Media organisations will face fines of up to 5 million rubles (€62,000), that may rise up to 10 million rubles (€124,000) for repeated offences. Individuals will face criminal prosecution that may lead to severe financial penalties (e.g. fines equivalent to the person’s total income over the last 18 months) and prison sentences for up to 5 years."

Note that the legislation is not part of the emergency measures, Art 207 mentions that it is applicable towards information regarding events that threaten security and safety of citizens, which includes epidemics. It is therefore not coded as part of the emergency measures, but is considered in coding merepfact and merepgov.

## Limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 (*merepfact*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have the media faced  de-facto limitations on  reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting on the virus, its origins, treatment, and prevalence. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Despite having an official website with information on covid-19, the government has censored reports questitioning official statistics (prevalence).

According to IPI, "On March 19, the country’s media regulatory agency, Roskomnadzor, which has a history of censoring the independent press, demanded that more than 20 media outlets remove content it deemed “inaccurate, socially significant information” about the coronavirus from their websites. Among them was radio station Echo of Moscow, which was pressured to remove the recording and transcript of an interview with a disease expert who criticized the government’s handling of the health crisis." Moreover, "media outlets will also be fined up to €117,000 if they publish disinformation about the outbreak, raising further concerns that the broadly defined law will be used to target media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak." Based on this legislation, merepfact is coded as 1 in all time periods.

## Limitations on media reporting about the government response to Covid-19 (*merepgov*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020,  have the media faced  de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news on the government responses to Covid-19. If this includes limitations on reporting about the government's official messaging on the pandemic (e.g. its prevalence, treatment, or origins), code this and *merepfact* as 1- Yes. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. The overall media environment is to be considered when coding this variable. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 According to Reporters without Border, at the end of March "the regional online newspaper Magadan Govorit was forced to delete a story at the start of the week about the death of a patient suspected of having the virus who finally tested negative. The newspaper said its information was reliable and verified, and did not give the cause of death. Roskomnadzor nonetheless insisted on its deletion." 

According to CPJ, "On June 9, a court in the central Russian city of Ufa fined Timur Almaev, chief editor of independent news website ProUfu, 60,000 rubles ($862) after the outlet published a story alleging that one thousand graves were dug in Ufa for possible victims of COVID-19... police in the town of Sivirsky, outside St. Petersburg, questioned Tatyana Voltskaya, a reporter with the U.S. Congress-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, over an April 11 report for the broadcaster that alleged hospitals lacked the supplies to respond to the pandemic. Authorities opened an investigation into that article on April 25, and allege that Voltskaya was “spreading false news,” she said. If charged and convicted, she could face a fine and up to five years in jail under the Russian criminal code."  Another journalist, Aleksandr Pichugin, was fined for spreading "false information" because of a satirical post on Covid-19 restrictions.

The government passed ammendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code (on spreading disinformation) which was used to censor reporting on the government's handling of the pandemic.  According to IPI, "On March 19, the country’s media regulatory agency, Roskomnadzor, which has a history of censoring the independent press, demanded that more than 20 media outlets remove content it deemed “inaccurate, socially significant information” about the coronavirus from their websites. Among them was radio station Echo of Moscow, which was pressured to remove the recording and transcript of an interview with a disease expert who criticized the government’s handling of the health crisis." Moreover, "media outlets will also be fined up to €117,000 if they publish disinformation about the outbreak, raising further concerns that the broadly defined law will be used to target media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak."

## Limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news (*merepoth*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020,  has the government placed de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid-19 related news, but with reference to the pandemic?

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the de-facto limitation of media reporting about news unrelated to the pandemic, justified by the government under its emergency response to Covid-19. These limits may or may not be allowed by law. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

*Comments*:
 Journalist David Frenkel was reporting on voting irregularities on 30 June and "a police officer and an election observer from the ruling United Russia party attacked Frenkel and broke his arm at a polling station in central St. Petersburg." He was fined for "llegedly disobeying police, interfering with an election, and violating the COVID-19 lockdown" on 27 July.  Since it was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in July-September, October-December 2020.

## Limitations on access to information (*meinf*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does the government and its agents limit media access to Covid-19 related information? 

 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in how often the government and/or its agents limit media access to information about the nature of the Covid-19 virus (i.e. its origins, treatment, and prevalence), the government response, and/or other matters related to the pandemic. Provide specific references to sources and comments to justify coding.

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-2) 

 0. Never or almost never. There are no or almost no reports of the government or its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.  
  1. Occasional. There are a few isolated reports of the government or government officials limiting media access to Covid-19 related information, but these are not systematic or ongoing. 
 2. Often. There are widespread and ongoing reports of the government and its agents limiting media access to Covid-19 related information.

 
*Time period: Q2*: 2

*Time period: Q4*: 2

 

*Comments*:
 According to Reporters without Border, "media access to information is meanwhile being restricted more and more. Since 17 March, reporters cannot attend an event at which Vladimir Putin is present unless their temperature has been taken at least three times" and "on 19 March, foreign reporters were denied access to the Russian parliament." IPI reports that "Requests in Russia often go unanswered" and cites a source that says "In Russia, the closure of many regional government bodies means it is not possible to request information. Other public authorities are not responding within the legal timeframe. Examples include a request by human rights activists to the Moscow Department of IT about the facial recognition system made on 9th April. Despite a seven-day time limit for responding, there was still no response by 23rd April." 

Additionally, according to IPI, "individual medical professionals have been banned from speaking to media, while heads of health institutions have to seek approval and coordinate with central authorities before giving interviews to the press...Gathering information from “unofficial” sources or conducting anonymous interviews meanwhile risks sanctions or a police investigation." According to Human Rights Watch, " On October 28, the Health Ministry instructed all medical facilities that any public comments about the Covid-19 situation have to be pre-approved by the ministry’s press service. Later, the assistant health minister stated the instruction applied only to comments on prevention and treatment of the disease and “does not affect doctors” capacity to comment on various aspects of their work, including problematic ones." However, given the retaliation against medical personnel who offered critical comments, it’s reasonable to believe this instruction is intended to have a chilling effect."

## Government disinformation (*govdis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to fact check what is false, please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses). Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the *_source* and *_comments* fields).

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO.

*Comments*:
 Overall the information is in line with WHO recommendations (https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/) but there are some reports of state-owned media outlets spreading false information, e.g. a video aired on state-owned Rossiya 24 channel spreading conspiracy theories about Bill Gates (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEtaaNNuVCI, taken from here https://euvsdisinfo.eu/covid-19-moscows-hand-shows-signs-of-shakiness/) & a video aired on Rossiya 1 channel spreading information that covid-19 may have been manufactured by the U.S. (https://euvsdisinfo.eu/coronavirus-russian-journalists-vs-conspiracies/). I haven't found any information that these statements have been refuted, therefore govmis is coded as 1 in all time periods. There are also reports on expressing concerns over alledged underreporting of covid-19 cases.

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in excessive physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19.

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures?

 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. ``The military'' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
