 Under the special powers provision, decrees need to be confirmed by law within a set deadline. In the specific case of a pandemic, the decrees need to be converted within a year of their entry into force. In the absence of such confirmation they will become void. Moreover, in the contest of the coronavirus pandemic, the House of Representatives has created a new parliamentary committee devoted specifically to requesting information from, and overseeing, the members of the federal government with regard to measures taken under the 'special powers' provision.'' (1)

According to article 105 of the Belgian Constitution (special powers decrees), ''the legislator authorises the Government (formally the King at federal level) to abrogate, complete, modify or replace legislative act through royal decrees, under some conditions. The special powers act adopted under exceptional circumstances determine the rationae materiae scope of the measures that can be taken and is always time-limited. The special powers royal decrees have to be confirmed by an act of the legislator within one year of them coming into effect – which is usually a very formal procedure, even if the minority government makes it slightly less certain in this case –, otherwise they will be considered as never having produced effect. Once they are confirmed, they are considered as legislative acts.'' (2)

*Comments*:
 Article 85 of the Constitution provides the President with the power to proclaim "a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145". Article 144 establishes that a state of emergency will be in force for a period of thirty days. Extension of the state of emergency for 15 days at a time requires approval from the two chambers of the legislature. Article 119(2) reinforces this obligation. The legislature has the right to declare the state of emergency over at any time. Further, Article 145 requires that the Constitutional Court reviews all ordinances under a state of emergency to ensure they do not derogate from nonderogable rights [1]. 

Nevertheless, there has been some confusion over whether the President can declare a state of emergency without Congressional approval. In 2007, the Supreme Court confirmed that the President did not require authorization from Congress to declare a state of emergency. However, in 2019, the Constitutional Court reversed this decision, ruling that the President was required to obtain authorization from the two chambers before declaring a state of emergency. In 2020, after declaring the state of emergency, the President sought the opinion of the court, which reversed the 2019 ruling and declared that the President could choose whether to consult the legislature or not prior to making a declaration [2]. The ruling did not affect the requirement for legislative approval of extensions beyond the initial 30 days. 

Measures in place since the end of the state of emergency have been made by the Ministry of Interior [3] and Presidential proclamations [4]. These make no reference to a specific legal instrument and have not required legislative approval.

 The president has the right to declare a state of emergency for a limited time of up to three months. The House of Representatives then has to approve this action. The Egyptian House of Representatives hav approved of all the extentions of the state of emergencies that have taken place since 2017.

Article 154 of the Egyptian Constitution states that "In all cases, the declaration of a state of emergency must be approved by a majority
of members of the House of Representatives. The declaration is for a specified
period not exceeding three months, which can only be extended by another similar
period upon the approval of two-thirds of House members. In the event the House of
Representatives is dissolved, the matter is submitted to the new House in its first
session."

 Article 90 Constitution: ''The decree proclaiming the state of siege or the state of urgency ceases to be in force after twelve days, unless the National Assembly, referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic, authorizes its [en] prorogation for a time period that it establishes. The Ordinances taken in application of the state of siege and of the state of urgency cease to be in force at the end of them.''

Article 23: (law L / 1991/016 of 1991)
The date on which the state of emergency or the state of siege ends is fixed by decree when this date is before the expiration of the 12-day period provided for in article 74 of the Basic Law. It is fixed by law when it is after the extension of the state of siege authorized by the National Assembly. 

Guinea had a Constitutional referendum that led to the Constitution of 14 April 2020 being adopted (2). 

''Unlike the 12-days deadline provided for decreeing a state of emergency by the President of the Republic, the constitution of 14 April 2020 does not set a deadline for the National Assembly as to the extension. However, the state of emergency ceases to be in force at the expiration of the period provided for in the ordinance adopted. And for there to be an extension, an authorization from the National Assembly is required, an ordinance issued for this purpose by the President of the Republic and an announcement of the extension in the official journal.

 The constitution states that both the government and the parliament can declare a state of emergency, but that a government-declared state of emergency has a much shorter time limit and can be terminated by the parliament. This was a state of emergency declared by the government, and the parliament did thus not approve it. Note that the system for declaring states of emergencies (and how long they have effect) has been changed by the entrance of the Coronavirus Law (see comments and sources for emlaw for more information), but the SoE is the same in the sense that the government introduced it and parliament did not vote on it.

 The Government did not need parliaments approval of declaring a state of emergency, and this is therefore coded as 0. Important to note however is that the government does need parliament to approve any decree laws that have been issued within 60 days, and it is through these decree laws that much of the emergency measures have been taken. But the initial declaration of a state of emergency did not need parliamentary approval.

 It looks like the Parliament does not need to authorize the state of emergency. The Constitution mentions:
Article 73 - Should the institutions of the Republic......be interrupted, the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures required by these circumstances, after consultation with the President of the National Assembly, President of the Senate and the President of the Constitutional Council. He informs the Nation thereof by message. Parliament meets without requiring to be convened. The end of the crisis is recognized by a message from the President of the Republic to the Nation.
And Article 74 - The President of the Republic initiates legislation concurrently with the members of Parliament. He ensures the promulgation of laws within thirty days after the law definitively adopted has been submitted to him. This period is shortened to five days in the event of an emergency.

*Comments*:
 The activation of the PHA and the POA both need parliamentary approval (1, 2). However, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and financial cushion to Kenyan citizens (4), none of the other measures were approved by the National Assembly. The initial Covid-19 measures were implemented with the Presidential Directive οf 15 March 2020, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: ''The Public Health (Prevention, control and suppression of Covid-19) Rules, 2020 - Arrangement of Regulations'', by the legal notice n.49 on 3 April 2020, and the ''Public Order Act'' (legal notice n.36, 26 March 2020), all with immediate effect as ministerial decisions.

''The Public Health (PHA) and Public Order Acts (POA) have been the primary legal instruments that gave authorities executive powers during the pandemic. A series of regulations, rules, and guidelines have been published including: curfew orders; declarations of infected areas and restrictions of movement; and regulations and rules on the prevention, control, and suppression of Covid-19.'' (1)

''a number of directives raise procedural questions. The procedure in adopting regulations has been contrary to the Statutory Instruments Act (3), which requires that delegated legislation be approved by Parliament. The regulations have been implemented with immediate effect rendering Parliament’s interrogation into legality moot. The National Assembly has declined to approve regulations on the Prevention, Control and Suppression of Covid-19 and the Restriction of Movement of Persons and Related Measures, but the State has continued to implement them.

The Judiciary has already taken a decision on the legality of the curfew orders, holding that curfew is lawful but finding the use of unreasonable force in its imposition unlawful.'' (3)

 No, the parliament did not have to approve a medical state of emergency. Note that the parliament had to and did approve the state of emergency enacted in relation to the Beirut explosion, but this was a general state of emergency which differs from the medical one in place for the Covid-19 restrictions, which does not demand parliamentary approval.

 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (7). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October 2020), local news reported the contrary (4.6). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April 2020 state of emergency. According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration, without requirement of parliamentary approval (8). According to sections 3 and 15 of the  Disaster Management Act, 1997, the Prime Minister may declare a state of disaster him-/herself (8).

 According to article 88 of the Liberian constitution, the legislature needs to approve the declaration of a State of Emergency by the President, within 72 hours, or the declaration is automatically revoked. There is no requirement that the legislature approves the National Health Emergency however, which can be declared by the Health Minister if the spread of a dangerous disease exists within the country. This is therefore coded 0 for Q4 of 2020 and Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The head of state is allowed to declare a state of national emergency/pandemic situation without needing parliamentary approval (laws made under this state of emergency - emergency laws - does need parliamentary approval however). For the Pandemic Act, this in itself was passed by parliament. However, the activation of that instrument which enables all measures requires no involvement of parliament, as the head of state declares a pandemic situation which triggers available measures (Para 4; National Pandemic act).

 According to article 69 of the Constitution: ''...The decree proclaiming a state of siege or the state of urgency ceases to be in force after twelve days, unless the National Assembly, referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic, has authorized the continuation of it.'' 

After the amendment of the law no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis in January 2021, the head of state can decree a curfew without having previously established a state of emergency, or to go through the National Assembly to prolong it. The Parliament however authorized the government through by approving this law, therefore delegating extra powers to the President.

 Q2 2020: According to Article 200 of the Constitution, a decision to declare a state of emergency is made by the parliament but "when the decision on the state of emergency has not been passed by the National Assembly, the National Assembly shall verify it within 48 hours from its passing, that is, as soon as it is in a position to convene." The approval of the state of emergency was made on 28 April 2020 by the parliament, following the first plenary session after the state of emergency was declared, therefore coded as 1. The Steering Committee of the Serbian Bar Association argues that the declaration of the state of emergency was declared unconstitutionally and "the decision of the President of the Republic, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency does not contain a rationale behind such decision, which makes it impossible to determine whether the conditions for the application of Article 200(5) of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia have been met, i.e. whether there was a reason why the National Assembly was unable to meet".

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: parliamentary approval is not required based on  "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti".

 According to the Swiss Constitution - article 185, the Federal Council is authorised by law to take emergency decisions without the involvement of Parliament, but according to Article 7d of the Government and Administration Organization Act of 21 March 1997, the emergency ordinances of the government must be ratified by Parliament after six months at the latest.
The Federal Council defined the Covid-19 crisis an “extraordinary situation” under Article 185 al. 3 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the Epidemics Act, therefore granting the Federal Council (government) with authorization by the Constitution and by law to take this decision without the involvement of Parliament. While parliament approved the Covid-19 Act, the Act does not require parliamentary approval for measures to come into effect, and parliament cannot veto measures (although the government is required to present the measures to parliament, and consult parliamentary committees before executing them). This is therefore coded 0 for all periods, as neither the ordinances nor the Covid-19 act requires parliamentary approval for measures.

 Section 5 of the Emergency Decree states that "the Prime Minister upon the approval of the Council of Ministers is empowered to declare an emergency situation applicable to the whole Kingdom or in some area or locality as necessary for the situation. In the case where the approval of the Council of Ministers cannot be obtained in a timely manner, the Prime Minister may declare the emergency situation immediately and shall subsequently seek the approval of the Council of Ministers within three days. If approval of the Council of Ministers is not obtained within the time prescribed, or the Council of Minister refuses approval, such declaration of emergency situation shall cease to be in force" (1). 

However, as the council of ministers are not part of the legislature, this variable is coded as 0.

 According to Article 94 of the Constitution (1), both the state of siege and the state of urgency are declared by the President of the Republic in [the] Council of Ministers, but require the authorization by the National Assembly for their extension beyond fifteen days. During the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency, the National Assembly may not be dissolved.

Article 86 also reads that the ''Government can, for the execution of its programs, demand of the National Assembly, the authorization to take by ordinances, during a limited time period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after the opinion of the Constitutional Court. They enter into force on their publication, but become lapsed if the bill of law of ratification is not deposited with the National Assembly before the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time period defined in the enabling law, these ordinances may only be modified by the law, in that which concerns their provisions which arise in the legislative domain.''

*Comments*:
 Turkey has used the Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442) as legal instruments to implement emergency response. Law no. 5442 on Provincial Administration, Article 11, does not require parliamentary approval for the actions taken by the Governor: ''a) The governor shall be the superior of all general and special law enforcement forces and organizations. He shall take necessary measures to prevent crimes from being committed, protect public order and security. For this purpose, he shall employ the general and special law enforcement forces of the State; the superiors and officers of such organizations shall be obliged to immediately execute the orders issued by the governor. b) The governor shall secure the border and coasts of the country, and execute all affairs relating to border and coastal security according to the provisions in force. c) The governor shall have the duty, inter alias, to secure peace and security, personal immunity, safety of private property, public well-being and the authority of preventive law enforcement. The governor shall take necessary decisions and measures to this end. Provisions of Article 66 shall apply to those who do not comply with such decisions and measures.'' (3)
Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) also does not seem to need parliamentary approval: ''the General Hygiene Law (Umumi Hıfzıssıhha Kanunu) No. 1593 is accepted as the constitution of healthcare services. The Law allows for quarantine application within the scope of “combating contagious and epidemic diseases”. Isolation practices and the quarantine of a certain region are described in Article 72. Authority to decide on quarantine implementation and other measures within the scope of combating epidemic diseases is given to the Ministry of Health for the country in general by the Article 64 of the Law numbered 1593.''

 The Public Health Act does not require parliamentary approval of emergency measures related to disease or infection. A state of emergency does require parliamentary oversight but a state of emergency has not been declared.

 Claiming urgency, the secreterary of state has power to make the regulations come into force immediately, but the House of Commons needs to approve them within 28 days or it expires. Due to this need to approve within a time limit, this is coded as 1. Each legislation as such has also been approved by parliament.

 The National Emergency Act states that: "With respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is authorized to declare such national emergency." The President therefore needs no approval from Congress to declare a national emergency.

 According to the Constitution, Art. 338, the National Assembly doesn't need to approve the declaration but shoud approve any extension [1]. Since it does not recognize Maduro as president, the decrees to extend the state of emergecy were considered constitutional by the Venezuelan Supreme Court [2, 3].

*Comments*:
 The Statutory Instruments (Chapter 295 of the Public Health Act, sections 9, 28, 30, and 114) specified public health officials as the "authorized officers" to implement Covid-19 regulations and protocols. While the Ministry of Health initially led the response, in coordination with the WHO, the president appeared to have seized control by issuing a series of restrictions in March 2020 that have been amended at various points and continue through Q2 2021.

 The President does not need the approval of Parliament to declare a state of disaster, according to section 27 of the Civil Protection Act. The Parliament is merely informed that such declaration has been made. Section 28 of the Civil Protection Act states: "Where a state of disaster has been declared in terms of section twenty-seven, the Minister shall communicate such declaration to Parliament on the day that it next sits after the declaration is made."
