 official website with information on Covid-19; no reports on disinformation found.

 Algeria has been using hydroxychloroquine after WHO's decision to stop the trial in June 2020 (4, 5). 

The government however decided to gradually abandon chloroquine treatment, and started looking for alternatives in August 2020 (1). In particular, the Algerian Ministry of Health is directed toward the use of corticosteroid therapy for Covid-19 patients, an approach that is approved by WHO (2).

 Q2 2020: Repeated advice from President Lukashenko on ways to treat covid-19 by going to the sauna, working the fields, and drinking, which is contrary to WHO statement that "there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease" (1) and reference to lockdowns as “psychosis”. The President also decided to host a military parade on 9 May despite WHO's recommendations against it (2). Coded as 2 in March-June 2020 since information provided by the Ministry of Health is in line with WHO recommendations.

Q3 2020: no new disinformation from the government, except for a statement by Alexander Lukashenko that 97% of the population who becomes infected with covid-19 shows no symptoms, which was made in July after the announced that he had covid-19. Nevertheless, I found no evidence that his position had changed. Since the Ministry of Health continues to provide advice in line with WHO recommendations (e.g. on physical distancing), govmis is coded as 2 for both time periods (March-June and July-September).

Q4 2020:  no new disinformation from the government, except for a statement by Alexander Lukashenko that cheese is an effective treatment against Covid-19. I found no evidence that his position had changed. Since the Ministry of Health continues to provide advice in line with WHO recommendations, govmis is unchanged and coded as 2 in October-December 2020.

Q1 2021, Q2 2021: I have not found any further disinformation from the government. Because a long time has passed since the initial statements, govmis is coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 President Bolsonaro and the Ministry of Health have consistently promoted the use of medications without scientific evidence to their efficiency to treat Covid-19, such as nitazoxaide and hydroxychloroquine (even after discarted by the WHO on June 17). The promotion of hydroxychloroquine is pointed as one of the reasons why two Minister of Health, Mandetta and Teich, have left the government during the pandemic. YouTube removed President Bolsonaro's videos in which he recommend using ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing Covid-19. The president has also criticized social distancing and the use of masks, and said his government would not buy a vaccine if it comes from China for political reasons. The Minister of Education, Abraham Weintraub, tweeted that covid-19 is part of a "Chinese plan for world domination". Eduardo Bolsonaro (president's son who is a member of parliament and president of the Lower Chambers's Commission on International Relations and National Security) has said that China and the Chinese Communist Party are to blame for the pandemic. The Minister of Economy said that the Chinese people "invented the virus". However, while some members of the government are constantly spreading false information about the pandemic, the local and state governments are disseminating information in accordance with the WHO and following its recommendations.

 Burkina Faso started a clinical trial on chloroquine against Covid-19 on 6 April 2020, to last for one month: 
''Like Morocco and Senegal, which advocate the use of chloroquine, the authorities have announced two clinical trials of this drug on people with Covid-19. However, Roger Nebié, the director general of the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique et Technologique (CNRST), told Jeune Afrique on the phone that the first results will have to wait.'' (2)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 There are widespread reports that Myanmar has misreported the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, but no sources have been found that state that the government has produced disinformation on Covid-19 itself. Myanmar has a webpage with numerous documents on Covid-19 and information for the public, but these are all in Burmese and Google Translate isn't able to translate this well enough for those documents to be examined. This is coded as 0, as no direct evidence of disinformation has been found, but note that the documents produced by the government has not been assessed.

*Comments*:
 Burundi's government during Q2 of 2020 had a different approach compared to the period after 18 June 2020, when a new President, Evariste Ndayishimiye, was elected. The previous government had downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, and even suppressed the real death toll. The new government changed course and has since admitted the existence and threat of Covid-19, with no evidence that this deviates from WHO guidelines.

Burundi's former govenrment had issued very broad, general and not very detailed guidlines on protective measures against Covid-19. Burundi's former President, Pierre Nkurunziza, expelled the World Health Organization’s expert team working on Covid-19 in May 2020, including the WHO’s top country official, its country coronavirus coordinator, its head of communicable diseases for the country, and a laboratory expert focused on Covid-19 testing, without offering an explanation (5). 
Further, government officials have exhibited disturbing denialism about Covid-19, and in an interview with BBC, Jean-Claude Karerwa Ndenzako, the spokesperson for the President of Burundi, mentioned that Burundi is a country ''that has signed a special pact with God.'', therefore ''immune'' to Covid-19 (6). 

However, after the change in government in June 2020, President Evariste Ndayishimiye announced that Covid-19 was ''the worst enemy of Burundi'', launched a mass screening campaign on 6 July 2020, and promised to fight the spread of the virus. (1, 2, 3). 
In addition, ''the health minister issued stronger guidelines, saying that people visiting patients at hospitals must “be supplied with masks and health personnel be equipped with protective masks,'', and that taxi drivers should clean seats and that passengers should wear masks.'' (4)
Yet, in September 2020, the health minister declared the Covid-19 epidemic in Burundi over, without providing data to substantiate the claim. (11, 12). 
Burundi authorities prescribe Chloroquine for those tested positive for Covid-19 (20 July 2020), and the Burundi health minister said that ''the medication has been effective and highly operative” (10). 

No information was found on whether Burundi continues the use of chloroquine after July 2020. We code as 0 for quarters that we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 In Cameroon, the President Paul Biya authorized on 9 April 2020 the local production of chloroquine for the treatment against Covid-19. (1,3)
''Chloroquine (Nivaquine) 500 mg or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used as a first line treatment with azithromycin 500 mg. These practices are subject to change as treatment research evolves.'' (2)

Cameroon continued using Hydroxichloroquine by August 2020: 
''The Minister of Public Health, Dr Manaouda Malachi presented the result to the inter-Ministerial Committee in charge of evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the Government’s response strategy against the Covid-19 pandemic in Cameroon chaired by the Prime Minister, Head of Government, Joseph Dion Ngute.
At the end of the committee’s meeting of Thursday, 13 August 2020 it was resolved that Cameroon will continue hydroxichloroquine as part of the treatment protocol for Covid-19 in spite of some health bodies calling for a stop. The Minister of Public Health however emphasised that scientific research continues and cases are being studied to assess the side effects of this medication.'' (6)

No evidence on whether the government stopped the use of chloroquine in the treatment against Covid-19 after August 2020 was found. 
We code as 0 for quarters that we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 Authorities in Chad have been using hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients since March 2020. The government has continued using the drug despite WHO's position against it. In June, Chad received by the Kingdom of Morocco two planes with medical products and protective equipment against the coronavirus, which included 75,000 boxes of chloroquine and 15,000 boxes of Azithromycin. (6)

''The president of the Scientific Committee on Covid-19, Professor Choua, guest of the national television newspaper on Sunday 26 April 2020, recognized that patients are treated with chloroquine.'' (1,2)

''After Morocco, Algeria and Senegal, it is Chad's turn to maintain "for the moment" its protocol consisting in giving Covid-19 patients chloroquine associated with the antibiotic azithromycin. "We note that there is a lot of debate around this question, but while waiting for in-depth research with convincing results, we are continuing our protocol" , explains Professor Ali Moussa, in charge of the management of this infectious disease.'' (3)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

*Comments*:
 Documents were leaked to CNN, indicating that China under-reported cases in March: “The documents show a wide-range of data on two specific days, February 10 and March 7, that is often at odds with what officials said publicly at the time. … Even though China has never revealed the total number of Covid-19 cases in 2019, a graph in one document appears to suggest a much higher number [than what they reported] had been detected. ... According to reports in Chinese state media in early February, Hubei health experts had expressed frustration with the accuracy of nucleic acid tests. ...the tests carried out at that time resulted in only a 30% to 50% positive rate, among already confirmed cases... ” (1) 

“One of the team’s investigators has already said China refused to give raw data on early COVID-19 cases to the WHO-led team, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the global pandemic began.” (2)

A Bayesian estimate of the under-reporting rate for COVID-19: “...we estimate that due to significant under reporting of the virus in China, the true mortality due to COVID-19 is less than half that currently reported, and the true number of cases is at least twice the number currently reported. … This misreporting most likely arises because patients experiencing mild symptoms choose to self-isolate, and do not attend hospital for testing or care. This will lead to overestimation of mortality rates and underestimation of prevalence of the virus in the community.“ (3)

China has been consistently suggesting without scientific proof that Covid-19 did not originate in Wuhan. Instead, a popular claim from Chinese officials is that it might have originated in the US and then brought to China. These claims have started since at least March 2020.

There are multiple reports that have been emerging in from November 2020 which discuss how China state media has been 'reporting intensively' on the fact that Covid-19 did not originate in Wuhan. I haved coded 2 based on the intensity of the Chinese government's reporting on this issue'.

A former chief epidemiologist said in a briefing 'Although China was the first to report cases, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus originated in China'. Chinese scientists have also submitting a paper for publication to the Lancet. This paper claims 'Wuhan is not the place where human-to-human Sars-CoV-2 transmission first happened'. It instead suggests that the first case have originated in the 'Indian subcontinent'.

State media and officials have been questioning the safety and effectiveness of western vaccines without basis. 

State media outlet CGTN and spokesperson from the foreign affairs ministry, have made statements claiming that Covid-19 originated in a military base in the US and not China in January 2021.

The Chinese government has also been forcing certain groups of people (namely the Uighurs) to consume a traditional medicine in the form of a herbal drink. The authorities claim that it is effective against the virus even though there is no scientific proof of this.
The government has continued to push conspiracy theories of the origin of the virus in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. Hence, I have continued to code this variable as 2.

*Comments*:
 The medical information and protective guidlines of DRC government on Covid-19 are similar to WHO (see 3, 4, 5, 6), but the government was using and producing hydroxychloroquine in Q2 of 2020:

''In March 2020 President Felix Tshisekedi declared that it was "urgent" to produce chloroquine "in industrial quantities"'' (1, 2).
''In June 2020, The DRC launched the 200mg antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine on the local market, in order to use it in the treatment of the new coronavirus, Covid-19. A laboratory has also been set up in South Kivu in the east of the country to locally produce the national needs for this drug.'' (7)

There is no info found on whether the government continues using chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 Gabonese authorities have been using chloroquine in the treatment against Covid-19 since March 2020 (1).
''The Minister of Health, on 28 May 2020, after a meeting with the Scientific Committee and the Technical Committee on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 in Gabon after the revelations of the scientific journal " The Lancet " and the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to stop current therapeutic trials, decided that the treatment with chloroquine would be continued with caution and that the Lopinavir / Ritonavir combination as indicated in the national therapeutic protocol could be an alternative to hydroxychloroquine if necessary.'' (3)

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 The greek government's information about Covid-19 related matters are in agreement with WHO guidεlines. However, several governmnet agents - including the PM himselft - have not been vocal enough on the issue of whether the holy communion can spread Covid-19 (1). 

''Conservative government officials have chiefly blamed overcrowding in bars and restaurants and seem loath to point the finger at the church, even though the disease has clearly spread through the ranks of the clergy in recent weeks.'' (2) 
''Also, state epidemiologists in Greece have differing opinions on the question of holy communion: Eleni Yiamarellou, a government health adviser, has publicly and repeatedly declared since March 2020 up to May 2021 that the practice poses no health risk to believers.'' (2) 
Further, two prominent MPs from the ruling party participated in the holy communion practice, in March 2020 and September 2020, with one of them stating it that her faith is stronger than the virus (3, 4). 

Although the greek PM has not defended these practices and incidents, he has nevertheless avoided taking a clear stance against the Orthodox church, or making his position fully clear on the holy communion issue.

 The information from the Kenyan government largely conforms to WHO guidelines.

While the Kenyan Ministry of Health initially approved a trial use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients and imported 379,000 tablets from India, it did not begin its trials before the WHO issued its advisory against the use of the drug. In response, the Kenyan government suspended its plans to use hydroxychloroquine (1). It has since condemned messages claiming that hydroxychloroquine is a cure (2)

Along with 12 other African countries, Kenya is now participating in the ANTICOV trials led by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), an international non-profit dedicated to finding affordable treatments for diseases (3). The trials began in September and are currently testing the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms (4). Because this is a drug trial and not an endorsement by the government, we do not consider it disinformation.

 ...''health authorities have continued to use Covid-Organics, a herbal product made with Artemisia annua and launched on 20 April by the President, as a cure and prevention for the virus and is being distributed in schools and communities across the country. On 3 May 2020, WHO published a press release welcoming innovations around the world, including traditional medicines, as part of the search for potential treatments for Covid-19, and warning about the risks of using products that have not been robustly investigated. The document specifically highlights that the use of medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua as treatment for Covid-19 should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects. The Deputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Kwesi Quartey, in a tweet published on 13 May 2020 informed that the Madagascar's Health Ministry had agreed to collaborate with the Africa Centre for Disease Control (Africa CDC) to investigate the remedy.'' ((1), August 2020). 

'The government has been distributing for free a so-called cure for the coronavirus, going against WHO guidlines.

''On 20 April 2020, President Andry Rajoelina himself launched Covid-Organics (CVO), an “improved traditional remedy with curative and preventive properties” against the coronavirus, as he described it.
Officially developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), the remedy is an infusion derived from artemisia and other plants which remain secret. It comes in the form of a liquid or infusion, with a defined dosage....The remedy’s discovery has also pushed authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.'' (5) 

When the Madagascan president ended the state of emergency on 18 October 2020, he mentioned that the country had 96% recovery rate, and partly attributed it to the efficacy of measures taken like the distribution of more than seven million doses of Covid-Organics distributed free of charge throughout the island. (2)  

Also, the President Andry Rajoelina was initially strongly against Covid-19 vaccines and instead supported and promoted Covid-Organics as a cure. The President changed course regarding the vaccinations, and joined the WHO-led COVAX programme in April 2021. This decision however will not affect the ongoing distribution of Covid-Organics ( 3,4).

 "The use of Chloroquine was validated on 1 April 2020 by the Ministry of Health", according to an official of the Covid-19 treatment center at the Hospital of Mali.'' (1) 

''In Mali , WHO representatives contacted by Studio Tamani refused to comment on this decision by the World Health Organization and on the existence of other possible treatments in place of chloroquine. However, the national coordinator of the risost against Covid-19 affirms that Malian experts have met to allow the country to adopt a position in the face of this situation. As a reminder, the use of Chloroquine was validated in Mali on 1 April 2020 by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.'' (2) 

No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

 The government, mainly president Lopez Obrador, shared false information about the pandemic. For example, Lopez Obrador said in March about Covid-19: "According to the information that is available, it is not something terrible, fatal. It is not even equivalent to flu."; that "it would not affect Mexico"; and that "people should still go out". He shared a video on twitter of himself hugging and shaking hands of supporters, ignoring recomendations of health autorities. When asked what he was doing to protect himself from the virus, the president showed he was carrying images of religious figures to protect against diseases. The president said that masks are not essential and that Covid-19 testing is a "waste of time and resources". He also traveled and met several people (without social distancing or wearing a mask) while with covid-19 symptoms, and was later diagnosed with the disease. While the president shared false information, the Ministry of Health and local governments are disseminate information in accordance with WHO guidelines, which justifies the score 2.

 Most of the information provided by the Mongolian government on Covid-19 is in line with WHO, such as how it spreads, what the symptoms are, who's most at risk if catching it and some of the guidelines for how to avoid it and mitigate the spread. However, they also include a set of advice on how to avoid catching it and what to do if you contract it that is not in line with WHO. These include that avoiding Covid-19 is more likely if one "Drink warm liquids frequently and use cups with lids, Rinse mouth and throat with lukewarm water with salt, lemon and soda, Get a good night's sleep, Calm and stress free, and, Do not use elevators on floors 1-5". Furthermore, it's stated that to avoid contracting it, elderly should among other things "Eat low-salt, sugary, and low-fat foods, Drink hot, warm liquids frequently, Get a good night's sleep, and Calm, no stress, no fatigue".As these are misleading statements that are not in accordance with WHO, but are presented together with correct information, and does not counter the content of those approved guidelines and infromation, this is coded as 1.Note also, that all these quotes are taken from using google translate on the Mongolian website on Covid-19.

As this information continues to be presented in the official website, the variable is coded as 1 on all periods.

 Morocco has been insisting on the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment against Covid-19 despite WHO's decision to stop the trial. On 27 May 2020, Moroccan authorities decided to continue the use of the chloroquine-based treatment protocol. 
The Moroccan Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb ''also returned to the treatment protocol put in place by Morocco and the use of Chloroquine which has “proven itself”.'' (1)

“There are tests and in view of some, it has a certain effectiveness against the entry of the virus into the cell and allows very early on to reduce the viral load and contagion”, he assured. And to add, further, that chloroquine “allows to reduce the viral load from the 5th day and make the patient non-contagious” (1) (September 2020). 

Morocco continues the use of chloroquine in Covid-19 treatment as of May 2021 (2).

 Ortega said the coronavirus "is a sign that God," who does not want governments "to spend billions of dollars on atomic bombs, on military bases and alliances."

Government members do not wear masks in public and criticize people who self-isolate saying it is a "radical" measure. The group Anonymous published data that allegedly proves that the government has been underreporting the number of cases and deaths.

*Comments*:
 The Nigerien authorities have been using chloroquine since March 2020 in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. 
In May 2020, ''The Health Ministry decided to continue the medical care of patients with Covid-19 through the current protocol in force based on chloroquine associated with azithromycin. This, despite the recent publication of a study concluding that they are ineffective against this pandemic....For Niger, this treatment "remains at this date the only alternative pending a new protocol", explains the government in a press release'' (1)
No evidence was found on whether the government changed its policy on the use of chloroquine after June 2020. We code as 0 for quarters after Q2 2020 because we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

*Comments*:
 The Nigerian government is importing a herbal "miracle medicine" from Madagascar, which has been advised by the WHO not to cure Covid-19. However, contrary to several other countries that import the herbal drink, Nigerian officials and the president say the drink will be subjected to strict clinical testing for verification of its effect before it's released to the public. Based on the testing decision, importing this drink is not included in the score. 

Otherwise, the government Covid-19 information is similar to that of the WHO.

*Comments*:
 North Korea has claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. However, experts find this hard to believe given the country’s proximity to China and South Korea. These two countries have been hit hard by the pandemic. There has also been one report of a North Korean who was shot while attempting to defect to China on 20 April 2020. He was transported to a hospital in Longjing, Jilin province and was later tested to positive for Covid-19. However, this case was only reported by one news outlet- the Daily NK. It is an online newspaper focusing on issues relating to North Korea and is based in South Korea.

In October 2020, North Korea warned its citizens to stay indoors over fears that 'yellow dust' which blows from China could bring Covid-19 to the country. However, there has been no link between these seasonal dust clouds and Covid-19.

 Authorities in the Republic of Congo ordered and received large quantities of Covid-organics from Madagascar during Q2 of 2020, but the Covid-19 Government Committee abandoned the experiment (in July 2020) because of non-response to the treatment by patients. (1)

''Asked about the controversial treatment against Covid-19 from the traditional pharmacopoeia, which was developed in Madagascar and which the Congo intends to try on its territory, Denis Sassou-Nguesso explains that lives are at stake. "We think that all the trials that have been done elsewhere and that have shown some signs of effectiveness […], we too must try them to try to save lives ".''

''Regarding the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the official said the convincing results of the use of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were confirmed.
Professor Moussa Seydi, head of the infectious diseases department at Fann hospital, said this combination will be continued in Senegal.
“Currently, the analysis of our data collected from 838 patients. The results that we have obtained on the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have confirmed the efficiency of this combination,”'' (1)

According to local media reports, Branimir Nestorovic has not made any more controversial statements since June 2020.  Nevertheless, I haven't found any information that these statements have been refuted, therefore govmis is coded as 2 in March-June and July-September 2020. Branimir Nestorovic left the emergency team in August 2020. Because he could not longer be considered part of the government or its agents and I found no other reports on disinformation, coding is changed to 0 in Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 201.

 1)  'Lifeguard Antiviral Herbs' was used for people in quarantine according to an article on a government website from November 2020.

The health minister promoted "Covid" syrup developed by a shaman, according to reports from Q1 2021. 

None of these remedies are mentioned by the WHO, therefore govdis is coded as 2 in Q4 2020, Q1 2021.

2) Senior government officials made public remarks in April 2020, blaming the Muslim community for the spread of Covid-19 in the country.

Even though there haven’t been additional reports on the government blaming the Muslims for the spread of Covid-19, there also hasn’t been any news on the Sri Lankan government correcting those statements. Sri Lanka has also been enforcing forced cremation of Covid-19 victims – a practice that is prohibited in Islam. The Sri Lankan government has claimed that this has been enforced as the burying victims of Covid-19 risks contaminating ground drinking water (3,4,5).

While the government has lifted the ban on burial of the dead bodies, bodies are only allowed to be buried in a specific place 300km away from the captial, Colombo (6).

However, guidelines published by the WHO does not mention dangers to drinking water. Therefore govdis is coded as 1 in Q2 2020, Q3 2020, Q2 2021.

 The government publishes information on covid-19 on the health ministry website (1). In March 2020, the health minister gave an interview to a state-run newspaper saying that covid-19 is less likely to spread in Tajikistan due to its hot climate. Coded as 1 in March-June 2020 since information on the official website is in line with WHO recommendations.  Since it was a single incident and I found no further reports on disinformation, govdis is coded as 1 only in Q2 2020.

*Comments*:
 On 22 April of 2020, former President Magufuli said in a live broadcast that herbal steaming should be used as treatment. Steam inhalation cannot treat Covid-19 and is dangerous according to experts. President Magufuli also stated that Covid-19 was the devil, and said it is because of all the prayers of the citizens that Tanzania is now free of it. Magufuli also promised to import a tonic from Madagascar as a cure for Covid-19, while the WHO advises that this will not kill the virus. Magufuli also said the virus is "satanic" and therefore cannot thrive in churches, and has in addition disparaged social distancing and mask wearing. Tanzanian authorities have claimed that they are free of Covid-19, and have not reported a case since April of 2020. Numerous sources disprove this, and Covid-19 is believed to be widespread in the country throughout the coded period.  
The situation continued in 2021, and there were reports of significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in Tanzania, which was met with continued denial by authorities. President Magufuli passed away in March 2021, and was replaced with President Hassan. President Hassan has not reiterated Magufuli’s disinformation, and also put together an expert committee on Covid-19 to oversee future measures. However, Tanzania has of June 15 2021 still not reported any cases, and the US embassy states that “contracting COVID-19 through community transmission remains elevated” [10]. As Tanzania continues to significantly misreport the extent of Covid-19 in the country, this is coded as 3 for Q2 of 2021 as well. 
Worth noting is that in June 2021 Tanzania requested access to vaccines through the Covax initiative and applied for an IMF loan to help with economic challenges due to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 The information from the government is similar to the information from WHO. However, the government has announced accepting a consignment from the Madagascar's president through an ECOWAS program. The "Covid Organics" medicine (a herbal tonic touted as a cure for COVID-19) was then said to be handed to the ministry of health for treatment of patients. WHO advises that there is no proof of its efficiency. No information was found indicating that patients are actually being treated with "Covid Organics". Information provided by the Ministry of Health conforms to WHO guidelines and does not mention Covid Organics. Therefore, we only code disinformation as "1" in the Mar-June period when the consignment of Covid Organics was received. No other evidence of any disinformation found during the coded period.

*Comments*:
 Togo has been using Chloroquine in the Covid-19 treatment and in May 2020 the national coordination team for the Covid-19 response decided to keep using it despite WHO's position against it. (1,2). 

The drug continued being used by July 2020, i.e. after June 17th 2020 when WHO officially decided to discontinue its trials for the drug after showing no results in effectively treating the virus. 
''The Government of Togo administers chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to Covid-19 patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against this pharmacologic treatment as there is no evidence that it lessens the duration or severity of Covid-19.'' (3) (4)
By October 2020, the government is still using chloroquine for treating Covid-19 patients. (5)

No evidence was found on whether chloroquine is still being used by June 2021. We code as 0 for quarters that we no longer found reports of the government using or promoting chloroquine. We do not know if it continued in practice.

*Comments*:
 In general, the Turkish Government's official guidelines conform to the WHO, but it has recommend treatments with hydroxychloroquine. For example has the Health Minister attributed Turkey’s at the time comparatively low death rate in part to the use of hydroxychloroquine. Furthermore, Hydroxychloroquine was removed from the official Covid-19 treatment plan on 2021-05-07, but was in place throughout the pandemic before that, and seems to have been used through the period as well. This is therefore coded as 2 for all time periods. Note also that Turkey has underreported cases to a large extent, which is not the result of limited test capacity or the like, but underreporting through using a definition of Covid-19 case that does not concur with the one used by WHO, which the government itself admitted to in October of 2020. However, this underreporting does not suffice to increase the coding to 3, and this is still coded as 2 therefore.

 In April the Ugandan government touted hydroxychloroquine as a Covid-19 cure. The World Health Organization decided to discontinue trials with hydroxychloroquine on June 17 and Uganda stopped using it in July, a month after the WHO stopped its trials. Uganda's health ministry has fact sheets on its websites from the WHO and the information it presents is consistent with the WHO.

*Comments*:
 The Atlantic (6) provides a list inaccurate statements about Covid-19 by  President Trump (with reference to where the original statement was made), and why they are wrong. For example, President Trump has stated that it would disappear come warmer weather, that it would simply disappear due to a miracle ("One day it's like a miracle - it will simply disappear"), that vaccines will be available much earlier than any other sources claim, that antimalaria medicine is an effective treatment for the virus, that injecting disinfectants could be used as a treatment against the virus, that many medical staff are using antimalaria medicine/injecting disinfectants as a way of protecting themselves against the virus, and that media outlets were overblowing fears about the virus to interfere with the election. Many of the claims have also been repeated, and when questioned, President Trump has defended many of them. However, government agencies and agents, most prominently the CDC, have also provided information fully in accordance with WHO, and have also contested many of President Trump’s claims. It can therefore not be regarded a systematic dissemination of information about the virus from the government and its agencies as a whole, but rather a mixed and conflicting message where President Trump often has provided information on the virus that is not in accordance with WHO. While the disinformation was most intense in the first period, statements have continued and/or not been revoked and this is therefore coded as 2 for all of 2020. However, no evidence has been found of such disinformation in the last days of the Trump administration, nor any from the Biden administration (or other authorities during this period). This is therefore coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The information provided by the government about the disease is in acccordance with the WHO but the official numbers are not reliable. Maduro said that Colombia was intentionally infecting migrants that were returning to Venezuela. In the beginning of the pandemic, Maduro also shared on Twitter that a herbal tea was the "cure against the coronavirus". The tweet was later removed by Twitter. The president also defended the use of Interferon and Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment to Covid-19, even after the WHO ruled Hydroxychloroquine ineffective. He also said scientists in Venezuela found a molecule obtained from a medicinal plant that cures Covid-19, but he did not present any scientific evidence. Facebook blocked President Maduro's account for sharing false information about Covid-19.
