 The President has the right to issue and sign decrees without the approval of Parliament at all times (not confined to the pandemic): 
''While the National People’s Assembly is suspended, the President of the Republic may legislate on urgent matters by issuing ordinances after consultation with the Council of State (the administrative court). Such ordinances issued by the President must be submitted to the legislative branch at its next session for ratification.'' (1) 

In March 2020, the U.S. Library of Congress reported that the Chairman of the National Assembly had postponed all sessions and activities as a preventive measure against Covid-19. But on 22 April 2020, Aljazeera reported that the National Assembly passed a new law to criminalize fake news in a fairly empty sitting due to social distancing measures. In addition, the IDEA data on legislatures says that the Algerian National Assembly has normal procedure in April 2020. 
The legislature is still not entirely suspended, given that any laws passed while the legislature was temporarily suspended must be retroactively agreed to, but severe restrictions on who can attend and take the floor in the legislature (4, 5). 

Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune called for early legislative elections on 12 June 2021 and dissolved the National People's Assembly on 18 February 2021 (8), but this is a procedural dissolution for election purposes.

 The Constitution (Article 237) establishes that, while the state of emergency is in force, no amendment to the constitution can be made, but the president can rule by decree on covid-19 matters, as allowed by the Law nº 17/91, Article 20. The president continued to rule by decree during the state of calamity, since according to the Law nº 14/20 (Article 11) "The holder of the Executive Branch is responsible for: [...] c) declaring the situation of catastrophe or public calamity; d) Adopt, in the case provided for in the preceding paragraph, measures aimed at restoring normality; [...] h) To assume the direction of operations in the event of catastrophe or public calamity".

*Comments*:
 When a Biosecurity Emergency is in place, the "Biosecurity Act provides that emergency requirements determined by the Health Minister under subsection 477(1) are not subject to disallowance by the Parliament." [2].  However, these powers given to the Health Minister are fairly narrow and focused on health-related measures. This is therefore coded as 2 - the Health Minister has the right to rule by decree on narrowly Covid-19 related issues. The Biosecurity Emergency has been extended several times, and is currently set to end 2021-09-17. No changes in the emergency legislation or underlying legislation has been found that would propose a change in coding over time, and this is therefore coded as 2 for all periods.
Note also that the Australian parliament in two instances during 2020  suspended physical meetings by the federal parliament for health reasons. This was complemented with ways of convening via technological communications, and committees and the like continued to hold meetings. The senate also established a committee on April 8 2020 to scrutinize and evaluate the governments work and actions on Covid-19. Thus, the Biosecurity Emergency has increased the governments power to rule by decree in some areas, and the parliament has at times had physical suspension of meetings, but the parliament has continued to work in other ways.

There's no indication of the lawmaking role of the parliament being decreased during or due to this first Covid-19 Law, and no mention of such measures or consequences in Covid-19 Law text. The parliament has also voted no on some extensions of restrictions, postponing such legislation for 8 weeks to be voted on again.

*Comments*:
 The House of Representatives in March 2020 maintained only its essential meetings, which were subject to compliance with social distancing measures. The regional parliaments followed different procedures but also held elections, although with social distancing measures (2). 

''Most of the restrictive measures taken in response to Covid-19 were taken by Ministerial Decrees. These decrees are signed by one minister, authorized by the government, and are usually meant to cover secondary and complementary measures. However, both the nature of Ministerial Decrees and the Law of 2007 do not allow for this type of decision-making to implement longstanding measures that drastically limit citizens’ freedoms. The legal basis has therefore been found inadequate by numerous legal scholars, who have already called upon the government to create a proper legal framework for the restrictive measures taken in light of the pandemic. Without the presence of such a law that is adopted by Parliament and imposes limits on what type of restrictions the government can take, the measures taken by the Belgian federal government are currently unlawful and present a significant threat to the principles of the rule of law. It should be noted that, so far, the Council of State (composed of both an advisory body and jurisdictional body) has not seen any harm in the law that currently serves as a legal basis.'' (7) 

''The Belgian Covid-19 response has been widely criticized for its lack of a sufficient legal basis and parliamentary involvement. In January 2021, ten months after the start of the first lockdown, the government finally introduced a ‘Pandemiewet’ (Pandemic law), to serve as a legal basis for this and all following pandemics. (7) The Pandemic Law has not been fully introduced as of 17 May 2021. It passed its first hearing in Parliament on 7 May 2021. (8) 

''Parliamentary involvement has been remarkably low since the federal government has initiated its response to Covid-19. In dealing with the crisis, governmental decision-making has been the emphasis from the start...drastic restrictions on constitutional rights of Belgian citizens relied on decisions formally taken by one minister. Constitutional experts affirm that it is up to the legislator to decide on far-reaching constraints on constitutional rights in a public and open parliamentary debate, in order to ensure broad support for the measures and transparency as to why certain measures are necessary. The Parliament can, however, still ask parliamentary questions to increase transparency and oversight was indeed increased in July with the creation of a special commission (Covid-19 Commission) mandated with the monitoring of the Belgian Covid-19 approach.''

 Q2 2020: The legislature authorized the government to adopt emergency measures. All plenary sessions at the National Assemply were suspended for the duration of the state of emergency, only issues directly related to the emergency regime are considered. According to Democracy Reporting (p.6), the main authority during the state of emergency was "government via decrees (Parliament’s activities suspended during the state of emergency)." (1)

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: on 13 May, the legislature passed amendments to the Law on Health which introduced “extraordinary epidemiological circumstance” (declared on 14 May by the government). According to Democracy Reporting (p.12), "after the state of emergency expired on 13 May 2020, Parliament returned to work." (1) I have found no information on limitations on the lawmaking power of the legislature.

 On 16 March 2020, Burkina Faso suspended all parliamentary plenary sessions until 1 April 2020. General Committees of under 50 people will continue to meet. All guided visits in parliament are suspended.'' (1)

''Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have all declared a state of health emergency. This means that governments are allowed to rule by decree or adopt administrative measures with the objective of reducing the spread of Covid-19. During a state of emergency or health emergency governments can adopt measures that temporarily limit individual freedoms, such as freedom of movement (DW, 2 April 2020). 

Although the government had not asked any authorization from the National Assembly in the first month of the Covid-19 response, during the Council of Ministers on 16 April 2020, the Council deliberated on a bill on enabling law to be transmitted to the National Assembly (see (4, 5, 6)). Through that bill, the government asked the National Assembly to legislate by ordinance, based on article 107 of the Constitution which enshrines this provision for the benefit of the Government: “The Government may, for the execution of its programs, ask Parliament for authorization to take by ordinance, for a limited period, measures which are normally the domain of the law. The ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers after consulting the Constitutional Council. They come into force as soon as they are published, but become null and void if the ratification bill is not submitted to the National Assembly before the date set by the enabling law. At the end of the period mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the ordinances can only be modified by law in those of their provisions which are in the legislative domain."
The bill on the enabling law providing the government with the legal basis to take urgent Covid-19 actions within three months was voted on 5 May 2020 by the National Assembly (see 6). There was no evidence found on whether the law was extended after the 3 months limit-period.  

InterPares: Oversight: A fact-finding mission on the management of Covid-19 was established by the Government.Plenary: Proxy-voting.

*Comments*:
 During Q2-Q4 in 2020, the Myanmar parliament continued to conduct its work, and the emergency measures has not changed or limited their law making role as far as has been found. For example, parliament has debated a lot of Covid-19 related measures, as well as handling proposals for Covid-19 related law making and amendments (which they must pass for them to come into effect), during May and June 2020. No evidence has been found that the parliaments lawmaking role has been affected in Q3 and Q4 either. Noteworthy is that Myanmar held parliamentary elections on November 8 2020, but the existing parliament would not be replaced until February 1 2021 so this had no impact on the parliament or law making during Q4.
The new parliament was supposed to convene for the first time on February 1 2021, but the Burmese military staged a military coup, declared a year-long state of emergency and have not let the new parliament convene. They have also incarcerated large parts of the previous parliamentary members, some of which have died in custody. Since the coup, there is no parliament sitting in Myanmar, but this dissolvment is not in relation to Covid-19. It is thus coded as 5, parliament dissolved for some other reason than Covid-19.

Because the scope of the measures is vaguely defined, leglimit is coded as 3 in 2021.

 The National Assembly of Cameroon held its first session of 2020 from 20 March 2020 to 18 April 2020 and resumed sittings for its second session on 10 June 2020. Decisions regarding the emergency response to Covid-19 have come primarily through the Prime Minister's office or public health authorities, without requiring approval from the parliament. Such measures include requiring masks and closing borders, curfews, social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Some of these have been eased since 30 April 2020.

 Large parts of the parliament have been working remotely, and under unusual circumstances with smaller meetings, but their lawmaking role has not been affected. They have also passed laws on financial aid packages (Covid-19 Emergency Responce Act 1 and 2) during this time, and continued to sit and hold its sessions. No indications have been found that the national parliament’s power has been limited. This is therefore coded as 0.

*Comments*:
 While the Constitution authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency, requiring that the National Assembly enact public health emergency laws, the president has thus far avoided this and the government has enacted social distancing measures and other restrictions through a series of gradual announcements without reference to a specific legal instrument. The legislature continues to convene but with social distancing guidelines. On 20 May 2020, it questioned the government's response to the pandemic, citing poor performance despite its emergency measures. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled on 5 June 2020 that it would be unconstitutional for the president and parliamentary terms to be extended due to the pandemic. Elections scheduled for December 2020 and May 2020, respectively should continue as planned.

''On 5 June 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic (CAR) rejected as unconstitutional a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the extension of the duration of presidential and parliamentary terms in the case of 'force majeure'. The proposed amendment emerged in a context of the disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic causing concerns over the timely organisation of presidential and legislative elections in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.''

 The president may take measures by ordinance during the emergency situation, and the National Assembly cannot be dissolved, but Chad has been postponing its parliamentary elections since 2015, and are now delayed again because of the Covid-19 pandemic for 2021. Furthermore, according to Amnesty International's 2020 report, ''legislative elections were postponed for the fifth year and scheduled for 2021 because, according to the Electoral Commission President, the census was delayed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.'' (5). 

The National Assembly however has approved the extensions of the state of emergency.

''at the National Assembly, "the offices of the members of the bureau, the commissions and the general secretariat must reduce the presence of staff in the offices to the necessary". But "the work in committee continues with the strict observation of barrier gestures and the systematic disinfection of meeting rooms", ensures the Monitoring Committee.'' (2, 3). 

Procedural change, Parliamentary oversight: oral questions and interellations continue, Plenary: proxy vote (through a reform passed on 22 May 2020 allowing proxy voting), reduced staff on site (1).

 The Civil Protections Headquarters was given the power to decide on emergency measures related to Covid-19. The parliament limited its meetings and adopted measures for working during the pandemic (e.g. remote meetings, social distancing, sanitation, etc.) and it voted to dissolve itself on 18 May 2020, in preparation for elections on 5 July 2020. The first sitting of the new parliament took place on 21 July 2020. 

According to OSCE report (p.71), the measures were addressed retroactively by the parliament: "accelerated legislative processes have also been used to adopt legislative acts in order to retroactively provide a legal basis for government action already undertaken or being implemented" and "the Civil Protection Authority adopted quarantines measures and movement restrictions based on legislation that says such measures should be adopted by the Minister of Health. The situation was retroactively addressed by Parliament, potentially contravening the general prohibition of retroactive effect." (1)

The situation persists for January-March, April-June 2021.

Thus, the executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws.

Meetings in the parliament were cancelled from 11 March until 14 April 2020.

July-September 2020: Act No. 258/2000 Coll allows the Minister of Health to make decisions on "prohibition or limitation of contact of groups of natural persons suspected of being infected with other natural persons" (such as banning mass gatherings) ( Section 80(1)(g), Section 69(1)(b) and (2)): "The competent body for protection of the public health shall impose extraordinary measures pursuant to paragraph 1 in the necessary extent and shall decide on termination thereof." (1)

April-June 2021: Act No. 94/2021 allows the Minister of Health to make decisions e.g. (unofficial translation) he § 2 (1) "may order extraordinary measures to order the liquidation of the COVID-19 epidemic or the risk of its recurrence. certain activities contributing to the fulfillment of that purpose, or prohibit or restrict certain activities or services the performance of which could spread COVID-19, or lay down the conditions for carrying out such activities or providing such services".

 The legislature suspended plenary sittings from 18 March to 5 April 2020 with reference to Covid-19, but it continued to function as a body, with committee meetings allowed under certain conditions [1]. The President of the National Assembly was also involved in the pandemic response during this period [2]. The legislature resumed sittings on 23 April, where it approved an extension of the state of emergency, and it renewed the state of emergency several times until it expired on 22 July 2020 [3]. Because the president declared the state of emergency without prior authorization from parliament and the measures were in place for 30 days without parliamentary approval, we code Q2 2020 as "2". During Q3 2020, extension of the state of emergency occurred through normal procedures and the legislature had the power, at any time, to end the state of emergency according to the constitution [4], thus we code this period as "1".  Since December 2020, the Ministry of Interior and the President have made several proclamations concerning restrictions related to Covid-19 without reference to a specific legal instrument. As such, we code Q4 of 2020 through Q2 of 2021 as "3" because vaguely formulated laws have allowed the executive to rule by decree.

*Comments*:
 The legal instrument, the amendment, does not affect the parliaments lawmaking role. It does provide the Health Minister some extraordinary power, but these powers are defined and demarcated in the amendment that parliament passed, and does not provide measures that could impact the lawmaking role of the parliament as such. When the legal instrument changed to the permanent law in Q2 of 2021, the same principles applied as far as I’ve seen, along with extensions into how parliament can oversee and scrutinize measures taken under it (as well as other instances such as judiciaries). Furthermore, when the government during the fall of 2020 proposed to replace the temporary amendment of the epidemics act with a permanent new law containing virtually the same powers, this was strongly rejected by parliament. This led the government to strike a deal with most parties of the parliament, thus involving them in the process of drafting the law. Thus, the initial permanent legislation proposed by the government could have undermined parliamentary scrutiny and power in the longer run, but it was turned down by the opposition and they arrived at a version of it that as far as has been found has no limiting effect on parliaments power. Finally, parliament has stayed active and working during the pandemic, and as stated been involved in drafting new legislation, as well as approving both the temporary amendment and the permanent law. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

 The legislative is still working, but the executive had the autonomy to rule by decree during the state of emergency. The Law on Civil Protection, Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, art. 25 says that "In the event that a State of Emergency is decreed, the President of the Republic will be the highest authority in the execution of contingency plans for civil protection, as well as disaster mitigation". The legislative decree nº 593, that declared a state of emergency, says that "The Ministry of Health shall perform all the necessary actions, in order to comply with the Plan for Prevention, Containment and Response to the Covid-19 pandemic and provide the essential public services to prevent its spread among the inhabitants of the Republic". The vague formulation of the law gives the executive the right to rule by decree on issues that may exceed Covid-19 related issues. However, the law also defines that the executive needs legislative approval for measures that impose limits to constitutional rights.

 The Ethiopian House of People's Representatives suspended all meetings until further notice on 16 March 2020. Since then, it has resumed sittings sporadically and with social distancing measures. Article 93:4: "When a state of emergency is declared, the Council of Ministers shall ... have all necessary power to protect the country's peace and sovereignty, and to maintain public security, law and order. The Council of Ministers shall have the power to suspend such political and democratic rights contained in this Constitution to the extent necessary to avert the conditions that required the declaration of a state of emergency."
According to Article 72 (2) of the Food and Medicine Administration Proclamation No. 1112/2019 [7] , Article 55(3) of the Food, Medicine, and Healthcare Administration and Control Proclamation No. 661/2009 [6], and Article 98 of the Council of Ministers Regulation on Food, Medicine, and Healthcare Administration and Control No. 299/2013 [8], the executive has the right to rule on public health issues defined in the regulations.

 According to the Emergency Powers Act, all decrees must be approved or repealed by parliament within a week of its declaration, and in case of repeal it will be immediately terminated. The Act states that:"The Decree shall be immediately submitted to the Parliament. The Parliament shall decide whether the Decree is to apply as such or whether it is to be repealed in full or in part and whether it is to remain in force for the period provided or for a shorter period.” The parliament was thus not limited in it’s law making role during the state of emergency. After the SOE ended, the parliaments role has also been preserved, for instance passing amendments to the Communicable Disease Act. It has also worked continuously throughout the coded period. This is therefore coded as 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was implemented in Q2 2020 based on Article 25 Constitution (2), and law n°11/90 of 16 November 1990 on the state of emergency. 

Art.25 mentions: ''The President may, when circumstances require it, after deliberation with the Council of Ministers and consultation of the Bureaus of the National Assembly and the Senate, proclaim by decree a state of urgency or a state of siege, that will confer to the President special powers within the conditions determined by the law.''
Article 4, law of state of emergency (7): ''The Government is authorized, during the duration of the state of emergency, to take any restrictive measures required by the circumstances.''
Law n°002/2020 of 25 April 2020 on the duration of the state of emergency was approved by the National Assembly which extended it for 15 more days. 

During Q3, Q4 of 2020, and Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the state of health emergency was implemented based on art47 of the constitution, that gives extra powers to the executive. 
Art. 47 (2): ''Besides cases expressly provisioned by the Constitution, the law fixes the rules concerning: The state of watch, urgency, alert and siege;''. 
The National Assembly has granted authorization for the declaration of the state of emergency and the new law of 11 May 2020, as well as for later extensions (see 3--6).

Also, there have been social distancing measures in place, and a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry dedicated to the control and evaluation of the management of Covid-19 (1).

 Q2 2020: According to Article 71 (3) of the Consitution, the executive can rule by decree during the state of emergency: "during martial law or a state of emergency, the President of Georgia shall, upon recommendation by the Prime Minister, issue decrees that have the force of the organic law, and which shall be in force until the martial law or the state of emergency has been revoked." (1)The government had the power to determine the measures and the parliament continued to oversee public health and economic policies.  The number of parliament meetings was reduced and voting was not held. According to Inter Pares, the measures were overseen by "Intragency Coordination Commission that included some MPs." (2)

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: Article 45 (3 (1)) of the Law of Georgia on Public Health gives the government the power to temporarily implement measures related to isolation and quarantine.

 There is no state of emergency, and no other sort of state of exception that has changed the Bundestags role. The German Parliament continues to work, however with fewer members present and a restricted programme. The Bundestag have also passed and amended federal laws during the pandemic in order to aid the states and population. Especially, the parliament passed the amendment that created the national-level emergency response now in place. Thus, no evidence has been found that the parliaments law-making role has been limited. Note however that there has been critique that parliament has been too passive during the pandemic, and let the government and the federal states coordinate most measures without particular involvement from parliament (aside from amending laws etc., which the parliament must do). However, as far as have been found here, this has not been due to the law-making role having been limited, but rather that the parliament has chosen to be relatively passive. At the state-level, also, there seem to have been less oversight and participation from the parliaments than usual, but this is not accounted for here. Thus, there’s no evidence found that the law-making role of the national parliament has been limited in any way, and thus coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 Through the Imposition of Restrictions Act (IRA), the president has the right to impose restrictions "in the event of imminence of an emergency, disaster, or similar circumstance to ensure public safety, public health, and protection" [1]. The president has the power to impose these restrictions with advice from a "relevant person or body", which is vaguely formulated and contradicts the Constitution in several ways [2]. Further, the IRA allows the president the unchecked power to extend restrictions for three month periods indefinitely.  He has used this power to extend the emergency measures indefinitely - often claiming "until further notice" in speeches, which directly contradicts the law.

 The executive has the power to make fast-track laws and decisions on Covid-19 related matters (using art. 44 of Constitution), but not to rule by decree, as these fast-track laws need parliamentary approval on a later stage.
 During March-May 2020, the Legislature continued working as normal, but with fewer sessions and fewer MPs present. The parliamentary oversight was and has been in place and functioning. 
''Plenary: Reduced quorum, Committee: Limited to urgent matters, Voting mechanism: Ballot paper, Staff: Non-essential are working remotely.
Used procedure of 'organized debate'. Committees can conduct meetings physically or remotely.'' (1, 2)
Also, the Greek Parliament decided to only vote on one draft bill per week, with priority given to bills related to the management of the coronavirus outbreak. (3)

In October - November 2020, the government implemented a few stricter measures in the Parliament building (see 8, 9), but these did not affect parliamentary oversight or legislative work.

Nevertheless, the government has been criticized  of eroding parliamentary scrutiny in the midst of the pandemic (6), mainly for having launched several non-Covid-19 related laws, many of which quite important (environmental bills, education), with fast-track processes (using the same legal instrument - art 44 - that is being used to deal with the pandemic).

 Art 8/15: The president can rule by decree during  state of calamity or a state of prevention, but there are limitations to what type of measures they can take. During the state of emergency, the gorvernment can restrict several constitutional rights and, due to the vague formulation of the law, the measures may exceed Covid-19 related issues. The possibilities are more restricted in a state of prevention. Other measures that were taken did not limit the lawmaking role of the legislative. The parliament has continued working, as the current law does not allow virtual sessions.

 The Assemblee Nationale has adopted social distancing measures (1). 

According to article 90 of the Constitution (2010), the President during a state of emergency may rule by ordinance for a wide range of matters: ''The President of the Republic may take, by ordinance, all measures necessary to the defense of the integrity of the territory and to the restoration or to the maintenance of the public order.''

All the extensions of the state of emergency were all approved by Parliament. The state of health emergency is renewed each month by the National Assembly, whose vote is then ratified by a decree of the President of the Republic. (5) 

Between 16 and 26 February 2021, there was no state of emergency in the country. The last extension had taken place on 14 January 2021, for a period of one month (till 15 February 2021). The President declared a new state of emergency on 26 February 2021, which was also approved by Parliament. (6) 

Guinea had a Constitutional referendum that led to the adoption of the Constitution of 14 April 2020 (4). 

''Unlike the 12-days deadline provided for decreeing a state of emergency by the President of the Republic, the constitution of 14 April 2020 does not set a deadline for the National Assembly as to the extension. However, the state of emergency ceases to be in force at the expiration of the period provided for in the ordinance adopted. And for there to be an extension, an authorization from the National Assembly is required, an ordinance issued for this purpose by the President of the Republic and an announcement of the extension in the official journal.

*Comments*:
 The emergency legislation put in place during the pandemic has not in itself regarded or affected the parliaments work, and no general state of emergency or emergency legislation has been declared that allows the government to rule by decree. However, the statutes on which the measures against Covid-19 rely, and which have been in place in Hong Kong since 2008, enables the government to invoke measures related to a health emergency by decree given that such a health emergency is present. Also worth noting is that the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) allows the executive to “make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest” and these should “have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment” [1]. But, as noted under emlaw, the ERO is not being used as emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore it should not be considered here, as the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance (PCDO) is legal instrument used for Covid-19 measures.
The PCDO has been used for emergency response to the pandemic, and the government has the right to limit the powers of the legislature, due to some vagueness in the law (e.g. part 3.1, 2b, 5.1a.) However, the law is much more specific than many others and the vagueness has not been used.

The parliament has also continued to work during the pandemic, and also has some oversight capacity in relation to the measures taken (although this remains somewhat limited within the legislation). Thus, this is coded as 2 – the executive branch rules by decree, but on Covid-19-related measures, as the parliament has not been limited in other areas (apart from the limits the parliament faces more generally, but this is not related to Covid-19 or measures taken to combat it).  It is worth noting that Hong Kong postponed their planned parliamentary elections in September 2020 by a year. This has however not affected the current parliaments work, and this parliament continues to sit until the next election. Furthermore, a set of pro-democracy legislators were expelled from the parliament, and others left in protest. Again, this is not in relation to Covid-19 measures, and is thus not taken into account here.

On 23 March 2020, the Indian parliament adjourned the first session of 2020 for both houses with reference to Covid-19. The parliament resumed on 14 September 2020. During this time period laws were passed without discussion. The opposition's demands with regards to individual voting and the sending of Bills to Committees were denied. In September 2020, two important laws unrelated to Covid-19 were passed without opposition members as they had boycotted the session in protest.

The Indian parliament has not been adjourned or dissolved again since September 2020.

*Comments*:
 In February 2020 Iran’s Supreme National Security Council issued an order to set up the National Headquarter to Combat Corona (NHCC), which was given extensive authority. For instance, the Supreme Leader of Iran stated that following the NHCC orders is a legal obligation. The legal grounds for the NHCC is unclear, and their orders seem to not be  legally defined (they are not subject to judicial review for instance, so they are not counted as laws). The majority of the response to Covid-19 has been handled by the NHCC, which has no obligation to consult parliament and parliament cannot veto their decisions in any way as far as I’ve found. At the same time, the Iranian parliament has continued to sit, and they have also debated and enacted other laws during the time (for instance financial aid packages related to Covid-19). Thus, their activities have not been suspended, but their capacity to be involved in the Covid-19 measures and strategy is limited. This can also be compared to if Iran would have imposed a state of emergency as stipulated in the constitution, where parliament needs to approve such an SOE and where they need to reapprove it every thirty days or it expires (although, during an SOE the government would also rule by decree, so parliaments role here would have been oversight as well as approving or not approving the SOE itself). Thus, the government and the Supreme Leader has ruled by decree through the NHCC, and the role of parliament has been limited in combating Covid-19 (note also that even under regular circumstances, the Iranian parliament is limited in the many existing restrictions where several formal and informal powers can monitor and veto the parliament's actions, but this is not related to Covid-19 or the emergency measures). This is therefore coded 3 for all time periods.

*Comments*:
 A lot of parliamentary work have been conducted remotely or with fewer members presents, and at times parts of the regular programme have been cancelled so that parliament only works on Covid-19 related issues. However, they have convened when necessary and they have passed the bills enabling the emergency response, and no indication is given that this response in turn has limited the parliaments lawmaking role or power in any way. Furthermore, after a first phase of only Covid-19 related legislation (a phase that also coincided with the forming of the new parliament after elections in early 2020), the work has gone back to a more regular structure, although with some adaptions to the Covid-19 situation. Most importantly, the law making role of the Irish parliament has not been affected either by the Covid-19 situation or by the regulations that enable the measures taken toward Covid-19 passed by the parliament. All acts, and all extensions, have been approved by parliament. There has been some critique that oversight by parliament has been insufficient, but this seems to be more an outcome of parliament choosing not to debate and scrutinize some legislation rather than not being able to or obstructe from doing so. This is therefore coded as 0.

 The new parliament was sworn in on 16 March 2020, and some committees and regular work was not fully up and running at the end of March 2020, and only a certain amount of MPs were initially allowed in the Plenary at the same time due to health reasons. The Knesset did not work according to a regular programe, but rather focused its work on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is once again convening fully, however. Note also that the parliament was temporarily closed for four days during Q2 of 2020 due to the speaker refusing to obey the regulations and initiate elections for a new speaker, but his actions were overruled by the court, a new speaker was chosen and parliamentary work resumed - this four day hiatus is not linked to any emergency measures, but was an act of the previous speaker himself that caused it. However, the SoE provided the government with fairly broad capacity to impose restrictions on Covid-19 related issues, and the parliament’s role remained limited when using this SoE. This is therefore coded as 2, since the government could impose restrictions related to Covid-19 without needing parliamentary approval. 
On July 21 2020 the Knesset passed the Coronavirus Law, which now underlines the governments emergency response, and in which they were given extended emergency powers during a state of emergency, as well as the right to declare it for 60 days rather than 7. Within this law, Government is also allowed to rule by decree on measures related to Covid-19 that is deemed acute and cannot be passed through parliament first. However, this law fairly strictly pertains to issues related to the emergency itself (and the powers only exist as long as the SOE is in place), and the parliament still has powers to review the passing of emergency legislation to later terminate it, as well as being able to terminate the state of emergency itself. Therefore, this is coded as 2 here as well  - the government can rule by decree on a number of Covid-19 related issues - from the point where this new law came into effect.

*Comments*:
 The Italian parliament has continued its work throughout the pandemic, although at times with several changes to the regular programmes and much work being done remotely or in the plenary/committees consisting of smaller groups. The Italian government has since the state of emergency declaration issued a number of emergency measures through decree laws, which in the Italian legal system is an instrument that allows the Government to enact measures that become effective immediately, but which must be voted on by the Parliament within 60 days or the decree is terminated. Consequently, while the government has the power to present decrees which are implemented before the parliament votes on it, the parliament can terminate it as soon as it convenes to vote on the decree (Article 77, Italian Constitution). Since the Italian Parliament have continued its work throughout the pandemic (and as far as have been seen, approved all decree laws as of yet), this is regarded as not having affected their law making role. Furthermore, there's no indication that any of the emergency measures themselves have in any way affected the law making role of the parliament. This is therefore coded as 0.
Note also that Italy experienced a political crisis when the party Italia Viva removed their support from the  government led by Prime Minister Conte, which then  resigned in early January 2021. This government was subsequently replaced by a one led by Mario Draghi in early February 2021. No indication has been found that this has affected the parliament or it’s law-making however, and it continues to be the same parliament that sits.

*Comments*:
 The law on the state of emergency could not be located, and the constitution is vague with regards to decree powers of the executive: 

''According to the Ivorian Constitution (3), ''when the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the execution of it international commitments are under grave and immediate threat, and that the regular operation of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by the circumstances, after officially consulting with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of [the National Assembly and the Senate], as well as the Constitutional Council.''
There does not appear to be any formal provision in Ivorian law regarding the functioning of the national legislature under emergency measures, nor does Ivorian law appear to provide for any sort of “emergency parliament” with devolved powers from the whole parliament to address crisis situations.''

''Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the National Assembly has limited all meetings to a maximum of 50 participants. The President of the National Assembly has requested that all members, staff, and visitors wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer available at washing stations installed at the building’s entrances and exits.'' 

The state of emergency gives powers to the Minister of the Interior. ''The latter can thus, by a simple decree, prohibit or regulate the movement of people and goods in the territorial district within which the state of emergency applies. He can reduce or prohibit, depending on the evolution of the situation, the movement of people or vehicles, at the times fixed by the decree. It can establish security protection zones where the stay of people is regulated. In the current case, this task falls to Minister Sidiki Diakité, Minister of Territorial Administration. It is therefore he who will pilot the progressive confinement procedure decreed by the President of the Republic.'' (4). 

Freedom House reports that the government used the state of emergency to change the electoral code by decree in the lead up to the 2020 elections. The opposition responded by boycotting these elections and the president won a third term with over 90% of the vote. (5) 

This seems to extend the decree powers well beyond Covid-19 issues.

This enables the executive branch to rule by decree on many issues.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency under the Defence Law gives the prime minister far reaching authority and full responsibility to enact emergency measures. The parliament still meets however, and can for example question the prime minister on the actions taken under the Defense Law, although their law making role is significantly curtailed under the state of emergency. This is therefore coded as 3. Note that the Jordanian king has elected a new Prime Minister in October, and that Jordan held parliamentary elections on November 12 2020. The electoral process was contested and critizised as it occurred during a large Covid-19 outbreak and offered no opportunities to vote by mail or the like, causing very low turnout. This, however, does not seem seem to have any further impact on the parliaments law making role, as it stays as limited as before during the state of emergency. The new parliament also convened and continues to sit.

*Comments*:
 The Kenyan parliament held a recess from 18 March 2020 to 14 April 2020, with an alteration to the normal recess schedule for Easter, but has since resumed sittings. 
The emergency laws allow the president to widely interpret and implement decrees, but only related to the pandemic. 

''Parliament has continued to rubber stamp the actions of the Executive and has in some instances wholly exempted some of the Covid-19 rules from scrutiny pursuant to Section 14 of the Statutory Instruments Act. Therefore, despite being mandated under the Constitution to facilitate public participation, Parliament has allowed this and its oversight role to be reduced to a cosmetic exercise which has unsurprisingly led to public outcry. As of 27 March 2021, government directives imposing movement restrictions and an extended and modified curfew have been put in place in response to the high positivity rates in the country. The executive has validated an illegal process by publishing the rules without parliamentary approval, once again undermining the rule of law. Public participation requests have become 24-hour alerts relayed to only a few select persons or organizations to tick a compliance box which cannot constitute meaningful public participation.''

 The Kuwaiti parliament initially postponed meetings and cancelled some sittings due to health reasons, but now continues to operate normally, and has thus not been suspended. However, the government have responded to the crisis using a series of decrees on emergency response, and has far reaching powers that limit parliaments law making role. Parliament has also continued to sit in 2021, and voted on other bills such as budget, though remains limited in their impact on the Covid-19 response as it continues to be handled through decrees. This is therefore coded 3 for all periods.

 The government declared a state of emergency in certain areas that was ratified by the legislature on 24 March and extended on 14 April. The Constitution (Chapter 74, Article 5, point 1) says that the legislature has authority to ratify or repeal presidential decrees on emergency measures (“The Jogorku Kenesh shall introduce the state of emergency in cases and in accordance with procedure envisaged in the constitutional law, shall approve or repeal Presidential decrees on this matter”, 1). The legislature ratified and, in some cases, recommended the government to make changes on emergency measures. There were also Q&A sessions where the government reported on the implementation of the emergency measures to the legislature. According to Inter Pares, the parliament followed normal procedures with limited activities due to the pandemic.

 No information has been found that the emergency measures has suspended or changed the parliaments work during the pandemic, and the parliament seems to be active as usual. However, all restrictions announced that have been found have been so through decrees by the prime minister, which were not passed by parliament and includes no veto powers from parliament, nor any clear demarcation as to what the prime minister can decide through decree. This rule by decree in relation to restrictions of Covid-19 has continued throughout the period as far as have been found, and no indication has been given that parliament has been involved in the Covid-19 restrictions. This is therefore coded 3 for all periods, as the government has had far reaching power to rule by decree during this period.

*Comments*:
 The Inter-Parliamentary Union, Reuters and two local media outlets (The New Arab and Arab News) report that the Lebanese parliament meetings were postponed March 10 2020 for health reasons. They convened a couple of times in Q2 of 2020, the first being at April 21 2020, and they have during these sessions performed a lot of the regular parliamentary work. The parliament has also continued to hold sessions over the periods after that, and has for example voted on a separate state of emergency for the explosion in Beirut in August 2020. However, the medical state of emergency offers the government extended powers to rule by decree in issues related to mitigating the spread of the disease (such as restricing assembly, enacting curfews etc), without need of parliamentary approval. Parliamentary oversight has also been more limited in this medical state of emergency than it would have been if the government had enacted a general state of emergency (which also would require parliamentary approval). At the same time, no evidence has been found that the government has been able to use this medical state of emergency to enact measures beyond those related to Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 2 rather than 3. Noteworthy is also that Lebanon since the explosion in Beirut in August 2020 have had a general state of emergency in place which seems to have granted them large de facto powers, and have also extended this SoE without gaining the by law necessary approval from parliament. These issues are not related to the handling of Covid-19, however, and the parliament continues to sit and does not seem to have been more limited in their law-making in relation to handling the Covid-19 crisis than they were before the August 2020 SoE being declared. This is therefore coded 2 for all periods.

 Prime Minister Thomas Thabane initially declared a state of emergency under 23(1) of the Constitution to prevent the spread of Covid-19 on 18 March 2020 (1). Two days after his speech adopting the state of emergency, Prime Minister Thabane issued a legal notice declaring the prorogation (temporary dissolution) of parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020 (2). On 17 April 2020, the High Court of Lesotho ruled that "the prorogation is not a blunt instrument available to a PM … to fight political battles or to frustrate parliament in the performance of its constitutional roles" (3,4). It immediately reinstated the parliament. Therefore - for the Q2 2020 period, we code the legislature as having been dissolved (4) because it was unable to function for part of the coding period. Media sources indicate that when legislators arrived after the prorogue decree - police escorted them from the assembly (6). 

Since May 2020, a state of disaster has been in force, and under the Disaster Management Act 1997 - the government has a list of specified emergency powers that are narrowly defined to the disaster itself (5).

*Comments*:
 The Liberian constitution, article 86a states that: "...Acting pursuant thereto, the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees contained in this Constitution and exercise such other emergency powers as may be necessary and appropriate to take care of the emergency." According to the constitution certain rights cannot be suspended and the legislature must approve and can revoke the SOE. Thus, for the duration of the State of Emergency, the government ruled by decree to a large extent, and with broad powers, but these were constrained by legislative oversight and within certain bounds. Article 87a also states that "Emergency powers do not include the power to suspend or abrogate the Constitution [or] dissolve the Legislature...". 3.3. of the Executive Law also provides the president with the right to declare curfews or quarantines, etc. The state of emergency ended on July 21 2020. Under the public health law § 14.2. the minister of health has extended rights to deal with the emergency. Paragraph 14.2 of the public health act maps out the powers of the minister of health under a declaration of a national health emergency, which allows for various measures to limit the spread of diseases (limiting assemblies and movement, strengthening health care and the like), but does not provide for any arbitrary interpretation of what is Covid-19 related nor any general emergency powers beyond those related to limiting the spread of a disease. The chapter in the Public Health Law makes no mention of the legislatures role in this, and the minister of health has the sole responsibility over these efforts. This is therefore coded 2 Q3 and onward where the public health law is the main legal instrument, as the minister of health has the right to rule by decree, but what the minister is authorized to do is delineated and only disease-related.

 The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988 activates the powers of the National Security Council Act of 2016, which gives the government and Minister of Health vast powers to rule by decree on a number of issues (see part V of the National Security Council Act of 2016). However, the parliament has convened and held sessions during the pandemic, and the government has not suspended it (although their meeting was  initially postponed due to Covid-19). This is therefore coded as 3. The situation stays the same under the extended control movement order, where the government can rule by decree on several issues, but the parliament still convenes and hold their sessions. There is no indication found that this situation has changed over the periods, or that the legal basis that lets the government rule by decree under this time has been altered. This is therefore coded 3 for all three periods.

According to 2B of the Proclamation of Emergency in Malaysia's constitution, the government would be able to introduce laws without the approval of the Parliament. Furthermore the parliament was dissolved and will not reconvene until the end of the emergency in August 2021. On 16 June 2021, the King called for the parliament to be reconvened to debate the Covid-19 recovery plan. As the parliament has yet to reconvene, this variable has been coded as 4 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The government can rule by ordinance in emergency circumstances, and without parliamentry approval: Constitution (1), Article 50 - ''When the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the nation,.... is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures commanded by these circumstances, after consultation with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the National Assembly and of the High Council of Territorial Units as well as the Constitutional Court. The National Assembly shall meet by right and shall not be dissolved during the exercise of these exceptional powers.''

On 18 August 2020 a military coup took place in Mali, leading to the resignation of the PM and President, and the dissolution of the National Assembly (see 4, 5, 6). Mali has been without a president and without a government since 18 August 2020. The country was being led by the soldiers of the CNSP (National Committee for the Salvation of the People) led by Assimi Goita (7). On 25 September 2020, retired colonel and former defence minister Bah Ndaw was sworn in as Mali’s interim president (11). On 15 April 2021, the transitional administration announced that legislative and presidential elections will be held on 27 February 2022 (12). 

Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, the Malian government declared a state of health emergency on 18 December 2020, to last initially for 10 days (until 28 December 2020). The government extended the state of health emergency on 23 December 2020 until 26 June 2021.

 The government, based on article 60 of Constitution, can rule by Ordinances on Covid-19 related matters (2). 
''The National Assembly adopted on 7 April 2020 the enabling bill authorizing the government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances, all the measures necessary to fight against the pandemic of Covid-19 and all its effects. In defending the text in front of the deputies, the Minister of Justice Haimoud Ould Ramdhane indicated that the situation also requires, in order to save time, which is one of the most important weapons of the battle, to transcend the limits between the executive and legislative powers, and to ensure that the legislature temporarily cedes its prerogatives to the executive in this area, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.'' (4). 

Social distancing measures in place - the Parliament continues sessions.

*Comments*:
 The legislative continued to work during the state of emergency, but the executive, especially the General Health Council (collegiate body that reports directly to the president) and the Secretary of Health, issued decrees to manage the Covid-19 situation. The emergency law says that "The Ministry of Health will determine all the actions that are necessary to attend the emergency" (art. 2) and, because it is vaguely formulated, it allowed the government to rule by decree on matters that exceeded Covid-19 issues. The "traffic light system" does not limit the lawmaking role of the legislature.

This is therefore coded as 0.

It is also noteworthy that Mongolia succesfully held elections on June 24, with similar levels of participation as previous elections, that installed a new parliament. There have been no reports found that the new parliament has faced any limitations.

 Based on Article 81 of the Moroccan Constitution (1), in extraordinary cases of necessity and emergency, the government can adopt decrees having the force of law, which are immediately binding on adoption, but require parliamentary approbation. On 23 March 2020, the parliament adopted the bills 2.20.292 / 2.20.293 (2) establishing the state of health emergency on the national territory and empowering the government, to take all measures aimed at the containment of Covid-19.'' 
Also, social distancing measures were taken in the Parliament, in order to both limit the risk of infection and to keep Parliament functioning. 
''the secretaries general of both houses reduced the staff on site to a core group carrying out essential duties, while others are teleworking. A communication and follow-up cell was set up to raise staff awareness of hygiene measures to put in place in parliament.'' (3)

 Once the National Assembly approved the declaration of the state of emergency, the executive could define measures to fight the pandemic (e.g. Decree nº 12/2020). The Constitution (Article 289) states that "The declaration of a state of siege or emergency cannot affect the application of the Constitution as regards the competence, the functioning of the sovereign bodies and the rights and immunities of the respective holders or members". (1) The Law nº 10/20, Article 34, delimits which measures the government can take during a state of public calamity.

*Comments*:
 Namibia has employed two different legal instruments in response to Covid-19. From March-September 2020, the country was under a state of emergency. According to Article 26 of the Constitution, during a state of emergency "the President shall have the power by Proclamation to make such regulations as in his or her opinion are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, and the maintenance of law and order", and this includes suspension of rights within the Constitution, so long as these are justified [1]. The Parliament must approve the state of emergency within seven days, which it did for a period of six months [2]. Since September 2020, the country has used the Public and Environmental Health Act to implement emergency measures. This law clearly delineates the parameters within which the executive can declare restrictions to combat a formidable disease or epidemic [3].  From March to May 2020, the Parliament took an extended recess due to Covid-19. Since then, it has been meeting regularly, with virtual attendance for the first time to comply with regulations concerning public gatherings and social distancing [4].

 Section 2(1) of the Act 'enables the Government of Nepal to take "necessary action" and "issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons" to "root out or prevent" the development or spread of an infectious disease.' [1]

The Act isbroad. Section 2(1) can, "provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19 both moderate and extraordinary." [1]

The parliament was dissolved on December 20th, 2020, with elections planned for April 2021. The Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional in February 2021 and the parliament was reinstated in March 2021. It was then dissolved again in May 2021, with elections planned for November 2021. Since the dissolutions were not due to Covid-19, they are not considered in the coding.

 The parliament continues to work in a more or less regular fashion, and keep carrying out all important task. They have also passed the Emergency Act on measures against COVID-19 and subsequent amendments to it. The Parliament has to approve emergency measures taken under "Tijdelijke wet maatregelen Covid-19" in a week. If no decision has been taken, the measures automatically expire. No de jure or de facto limitations on the parliaments lawmaking role in the emergency measures has been found, and this is therefore coded as 0. 
Note however that there was some critique about the relatively marginal role parliament played in the emergency measures up until the enactment of the Emergency Act, as the Covid-19 response was dealt with by the 25 emergency regions before that. This was a system where government and these regions coordinated the response, thus not involving parliament directly.

 The Parliament adjourned and only worked remotely during the State of Emergency, but have convened again. While the emergency measures did force parliament to not work as usual, it did not affect its lawmaking role as it continued to pass urgent Covid-19 laws during the pandemic, and are now working as normal with their law making role being sustained.Note also that the parliament was set to dissolve five weeks before electing the new parliament, which is standard practice in New Zealand, but that this has been postponed due to elections being pushed forward (the current date set is October 17). So the current parliament continues to work. The new elections took place on 17 October and the Parliament works and has had no impediments so far.

*Comments*:
 The Constitution (1) -  article 67 is vague with regards to to executive decree powers in emergency circumstances: 

"the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures demanded by these circumstances after official consultation of the Prime Minister, of the President of the National Assembly and of the President of the Constitutional Court. ...No institution of the Republic may be dissolved or suspended during the exercise of the exceptional powers. The exceptional measures must be inspired by the will to assure to the constitutional public powers, within the shortest time periods, the means to accomplish their mission."
''The National Assembly is required to approve with an absolute majority of its members the duration of the exercise of the emergency powers and to terminate them in the case of abuse.''

The SoE is declared using a combination of art 67 of the Constitution and the Law ''no 98-24 du 11 août 1998 portant réglementation de l'Etat d'urgence'', modified and updated by law ''2015-07 of 2015'' (see e.g. 2). This law could not be located. 

Nevertheless, the Nigerien Parliament, on 2 July 2020, approved the law ''n ° 2020-030, empowering the Government to issue ordinances during parliamentary inter-session and this, after opinion of the Constitutional Court.'' (see 3, 4). The government therefore seems to secured authorization to legislate by Ordinance during parliamentary inter-session periods in July 2020. 

Further, the Nigerien Parliament has approved the extensions of the SoE: 
- On 11 April 2020, the legislature approved the bill extending the State of Emergency until 11 July 2020 (5);
- In October 2020, the bill extending the SoE until 10 January 2021 (6); 
- In 8 April 2021, the bill ratifying Ordinance No. 2021-01 of 5 January 2021, extending the state of health emergency for 3 months (7); 
- On 8 May 2021, the bill extending the SoE to 5 August 2021 (8). 

Also, there has been ongoing oversight in Parliament and limits on decree powers: 
''The continuous functioning of parliament and its vigilance with regard to government action are a guarantee of good governance. Under the state of health emergency, the government and security forces have exceptional powers and the exercise of human rights is considerably limited. However, the balance that is imposed on control must take into account the need to protect the population against the pandemic as much as ensuring individual rights and limiting the abuse of power.” (9).

 March-June, July-September 2020: The parliament was dissolved since February 2020 due to general elections initially scheduled for 12 April 2020. Since the dissolution of the parliament had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4. The new parliament met at the end of August but has not approved the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency. Based on the government's website, the President sent the decisions to the parliament for confirmation on 25 August. According to local media sources from 1 October, it is still unclear if the parliament approved the state of emergency.

According to IDEA, "The country has been facing challenges due to the lack of a functioning parliament. After the European Council failed to agree on the start of EU membership discussions for the country in October 2019, then Prime Minister Zoran brought the parliamentary elections forward from November to 12 April 2020, seeking a fresh mandate. With a unanimous vote on 16 February 2020, the Assembly was dissolved, paving the way to election and a technical unity government was formed, a recent custom to provide all parties with confidence in the election process. A month later, emergency powers were introduced as COVID-19 swept across Europe, and the election postponed by cross-party agreement. The state of emergency gives the government the ability to adopt and enforce decrees, all in the absence a parliament to provide accountability." (1)

October-December 2020, January-March, April-June 2021: According to the Crisis Management Law ("Zakon za upravuvanje so krizi"), the Crisis Management Center has the authority to implement emergency measures during a state of crisis, and the government should notify the parliament about the implemented measures once a week.

*Comments*:
 During a state of emergency, the constitution in part allows for emergency laws (passed by parliament) and emergency regulation (decrees by the head of state). The parliament has approved three such emergency laws, and these constitute the legislation that outlines the overall emergency response. The capacity for the head of state to invoke temporary legislation, the emergency regulation, however does limit parliaments law making role to some extent. At the same time,  they are also restricted in time (expire after 28 days), can be revoked by parliament and may only be issued if the parliament cannot reasonably convene in time for passing such a regulation as an emergency law. This is therefore coded as 2.
For Q3-4 of 2020 and Q1-2 of 2021, which has the Pandemic Act as the main legal instrument, there is a similar situation – after a declaration of a pandemic situation, a national control group is formed that takes most decisions and has the right to issue orders and decrees related to combatting a disease. They are obligated to report to the parliament, which also has some capacity to oversee and question measures, but effectively this control group determines the Pandemic response, but within a limited set of measures related to limiting spread of diseases. This is therefore coded 2 for these periods as well.

 The executive has the autonomy to rule by decree on Covid-19 related issues. There was no parliament in place when the state of emergency was declared, since the president dissolved the congressed in 2019 and called for new elections. The new congress was installed after the state of emergency was declared. Congressists are mostly working remotely.

The state by alert is not recognized by the Constitution as a state of exception and the parliament continued to oversee and amend the measures proposed by the government. According to Law 55/2020, the government adopts decision to implement measures declared by the parliament, so the executive has authority to interpret Covid-19 laws relatively widely, but not rule by decree.

*Comments*:
 The government has made several proclamations limiting movement, enforcing social distancing rules, and curfews, and at one stage lockdown, since mid-March 2020 up to June 2021 (see 1, 2, 3). 
These have originated from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government, and the Office of the Prime Minister, who has increasingly handled the government emergency response through the Cabinet. 
All of these decrees have originated from the executive, without direct vote from the legislature. The legislature ceded decree powers to the executive by inaction, since it has not intervened to require the executive to declare a state of emergency or specific legal framework for adopting Covid-19 restrictions (4). 

The legislature continues to meet, but less regularly and with social distancing measures. The renewed lockdown in 2021 indeed affected the parliamentary meetings, which were held online, and the first time the Parliament convened since the partial lift of the lockdown was on an extraordinary session on 13 May 2021 ‘’to allow to vote on and allow the Government to take loans meant to hasten the distribution of electricity’’.

 The law (Article 69 Constitution) gives the right to the President to rule by decree in state of emergency, and the parliament approved a bill that gives the President the ability to "take, by ordinances, measures within the domain of the law to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic".Also, there have been guidlines on MPs to avoid physical contact and travel, but no other disruptions in the functioning of the Parliament.
The state of emergency ended on 30 June 2020. 

On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of April 29, 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. 
The parliament enacted amendments to loi no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. The ''state of health disaster'' was initially declared on 5 January 2021 on two regions, where a night-time curfew was also announced (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies). 

Senegal lifted the state of emergency on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures.

 Q2 2020: The parliament was dissolved from 4 March until 28 April 2020.  Since the dissolution of the parliament had to be extended due to covid-19, leglimit is coded as 4. 

On 4 March 2020, the President dissolved the parliament in preparation for 26 April parliamentary elections (later postponed to 21 June). According to Art.200 of the Constitution, the state of emergency is declared by the parliament and the parliament cannot be dissolved during the state of emergency. In case the parliament is unable to convene, the decision to declare the state of emergency is made by the President and Prime Minister. On 15 March, the state of emergency was declared by the President and the Prime Minister, which was not approved by the parliament since it was unable to convene because of a limit on public gatherings due to covid-19. The parliament did not function from 4 March until 28 April, and approved the declaration of the state of emergency (and other decrees on emergency measures; 44 decrees in total) retroactively on 28 April. On 6 May, the parliament voted to lift the state of emergency.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: Art 6. of "Zakon o zaštiti stanovništva od zaraznih bolesti"   gives the government authority to declare and implement emergency measures related to infectious diseases, so the executive can rule by decree on matters related to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 The government of Somalia has declared restrictions on assembly, school closures, curfews, and other measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic on several occasions in 2020 and 2021, without reference to a specific legal instrument (see emlaw). The decision-making appears to be guided by the task force made up of ministry officials and NGO partners, guided by the preparedness response plan. It is unclear the degree to which the legislature has made input on these decisions. Therefore, we code this case as "2" given the defined parameters for the state response in the preparedness plans. Note: From April to June 2020, the legislature postponed its sittings with reference to Covid-19 but has remained active since then.

*Comments*:
 A report from 7 June 2020, by the African Network of Constitutional Lawyers, reads: “It is worth noting that the government did not declare a state of emergency even though coronavirus was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a global public health emergency. However, the legal regime on state of emergency in terms of articles 189(1) and 101(e) of the Transitional Constitution, 2011 (as amended) grants powers to the President to declare states of emergency only ‘upon occurrence of an imminent danger, whether it is war, invasion, blockade, natural disaster or epidemics…’ and to cause such to be ‘submitted to the national legislature within 15 days.’ Owing to the far-reaching impact of the measures on peacebuilding and constitutionalism, one can argue that the national legislature should have been called upon to debate and approve measures to fight Covid-19. The role of the national legislature cannot be downplayed even in emergency as trust building and allowing check and balance to operate even in times of pandemic is a critical democratic safety valve. The constitutional command that the national legislative be consulted whenever public emergency is triggered is to ensure that requisite oversight on measures impacting on fundamental rights and constitutionalism is performed. There are critical voices already warning that the rule by decrees is thwarting any efforts to building a democratic governance in South Sudan” (1).

As the law prompts the government to declare a state of emergency and thereby include the legislature in the decision-making process of emergency measures, but the government refrained from doing so, this is interpreted as a limitation of the powers of the legislature. No indication of a change in legislature influence has been found since June 2020. This is therefore coded as 3 for all periods.

 Disposición adicional sexta/Disposición final segunda: the government can rule by decree on matters regarding covid-19 and must report to the congress weekly on what measures were taken. The measures defined in the Royal Decree-Law 21/2020 do not limit the lawmaking role of the legislature. While the president can rule by decree, this is not novel nor exclusive to the Estado de Alarma. The lawmaking role of the legislature is not affected by the emlaw.

 On 02 March, the President dissolved the parliament calling for new elections, originally scheduled for 25 April 2020. Shortly thereafter, the government instituted a 52-day lockdown. Since then, elections have been delayed three times, until 05 August, citing concerns over Covid-19. Since the dissolution of parliament is justified with the pandemic, March-June, July-September periods are coded as 4. 

In all periods, measures were declared by the government without reference to the legal instrument.  Some members of the government argued that the measures could be justified with Quarantine and Prevention of Diseases Ordinance (1), but it provides no legal basis for declaring some of the measures, such as a nationwide curfew (2). “Moreover, in terms of Article 15(6) of the Constitution the freedom of movement can only be restricted through an Act of Parliament or by regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance.” (2) Since the measures were declared without reference to legal instruments, leglimit is coded as 3 in Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

*Comments*:
 In Q2 of 2020, the emergency measures does not affect the law making role of the parliament, and parliament still needs to approve measures taken by the government under the amendment. The government can only enact regulations itself based on the amendment if it is of such urgency that it can't wait for parliamentary approval, and the parliament needs to be presented any such regulations as soon as possible and approve or deny it. 
For Q3 and Q4 of 2020, only a few restrictions were in place formally, as most of the response relied on recommendations. Of those restrictions in place, which were primarily restrictions on assembly in public places and restrictions on restaurants and bars, these were declared by the government without involvement from the legislature (nor any requirement that they need to be approved by the legislature after having been declared). Given this limited role of the legislature, this is coded 1 for these two quarters. Note that the government did not have de jure or de facto possibility to widely interpret Covid-19 related legislation, nor impose a wide set of restrictions. Rather, they were fairly limited in what they were legally able to restrict. But since those available restrictions did not involve the legislature, this is still coded as 1. 
For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, suing the Covid-19 Act, no limitaitons on the parliaments law making role have been found.
The Swedish parliament has also continued to work throughout the pandemic (although with some restrictions on how many can convene at the same time physically), passed and amended several laws, and have been able to scrutinize the government and its actions. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 The emergency situation allows the Federal Council to enact ordinances to mitigate the emergency that the parliament does not need to approve (but which will expire after 6 months if it does not approve it), through the emergency situation as it is regulated in the constitution (Article 185) and the Epidemics Act. Consequently, the Constitution and Empidemics Act gives the government a right to narrowly rule by decree (measures must be related to the emergency, and they expire if parliament don't approve them).
Ordinance 1, 2 and 3 were introduced and implemented without parliamentary approval, but the Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) passed on 25 September 2020 the Federal Covid-19 Act (Federal Act on the Statutory Principles for Federal Council Ordinances on Combating the COVID-19 Epidemic) which creates a legal basis allowing the Federal Council to maintain the measures resolved by emergency decree that are still necessary to manage the Covid-19 epidemic, i.e. it authorized the Federal Council’s use of special powers. While parliament approved the Act, it does not require parliamentary approval for measures to come into effect, and parliament cannot veto measures (although the government is required to present the measures to parliament, and consult parliamentary committees before executing them). Consequently, parliament has not been involved a lot in the Covid-19 response, and the measures have more or less all been taken by the government. At the same time, the legislation that underlies the ordinances and the Covid-19 Act does not allow for arbitrary interpretations of what are relevant measures for limiting the spread of Covid-19, nor have they powers to rule by decree more generally through this. Thus, the government has handled the Covid-19 response with fairly little influence from parliament, but the powers are limited to Covid-19 related issues. This is the case both under the period using the ordinances, and the periods when the Covid-19 Act came into effect. This is therefore coded 2 for all periods.

 The parliament was dissolved following the death of three MPs. Neither their deaths or the suspension is officially related to Covid-19. Rather, the dissolvement is because of an upcoming election. According to the constitution, the president must dissolve the legislature before elections are held (Article 90). After the elections on October 28 2020, the new parliament convened for the first time on November 12 2020. No evidence of any limitations in the lawmaking role in relation to Covid-19 has been found after that either, and Tanzania has continued to implement only minimal restrictions. This is therefore coded as 0 for all periods.

 On 30 March 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus, all the consequent measures taken, including the declaration of the state of emergency, had already been authorized by the National Assembly, and in addition as article 5 of the Law No. 2020-005 mentions, ''During the empowerment period, the Government shall communicate to the National Assembly, at its request, any measure taken or implemented in application of this law.'' The Law No. 2020-005 clearly lists all the domains and the specific policy areas that the Government may decide on.Art. 94 of the Constitution also clarifies that the the National Assembly may not be dissolved during the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency'.The National Assembly has also taken some social distancing measures.

The extension of the state of emergency until March 2021 was also approved by the National Assembly: 
''Indeed, the deputies who met for a plenary session yesterday authorized the government to extend the state of emergency for another six months. In detail, two bills were passed by the Assembly: The first extends the time limit for the government to take its measures by ordinance for six months and the second authorizes it to extend the state of emergency.'' (5) 

The National Assembly also approved the last extension of the state of health emergency on 16 March 2021, until mid-September 2021 .

 The Constitution, Article 70 states: "...for a limited period not exceeding two months, and for a specific purpose, the Head of Government [can] issue decree-laws of a legislative character, to be submitted for ratification to the Assembly immediately after the end of the period of authorization." 
Article 80:"In the event of imminent danger threatening the nation's institutions or the security or independence of the country, and hampering the normal functioning of the state, the President of the Republic may take any measures necessitated by the exceptional circumstances, after consultation..."
However, Article 80 also specifies that the Assembly of the Representatives of the People (ARP) "shall be deemed to be in a state of continuous session throughout such a period" [1]. 

The government has activated article 70 of the Constitution: 
‘’The law on delegating powers to the Prime Minister to issue decree-laws, pursuant to Article 70 of the Constitution, had been submitted to the Presidency of the Republic after its adoption last Saturday by the House of People’s Representatives (HPR), a parliamentary source told TAP Monday.‘’ 

The ARP however has also been empowered during the pandemic: 
In particular, ''on 26 March 2020, the ARP set out six exceptional temporary measures to ensure the continuity of Parliament’s work during COVID-19:
1) The Assembly Bureau is empowered to set exceptional deadlines to accelerate the examination of urgent bills related to managing the crisis.
2) Plenary parliamentary sessions will be held on time and with no need for a quorum.
3) The Assembly Bureau may decide to organize remote plenary sessions with electronic voting using a special application, provided the vote can be authenticated.
4) The Assembly Bureau is empowered to reduce the time for dialogue with the Government and statements during plenary.
5) The Assembly crisis cell oversees Government action when the Parliament is not sitting in plenary.
6) Meetings of the Assembly Bureau, heads of political blocs, and committees may be held remotely.

Other measures include setting up a crisis unit comprising members of the Assembly Bureau and presidents of parliamentary groups to oversee the government’s response to the pandemic. The unit has met with the government several times to discuss the health, social, economic and security-related consequences of the pandemic and ways to contain COVID-19. It has also set up hearings with civil society and the government to discuss public policy aimed at managing the crisis.

The Assembly also adopted draft legislation on 19 April to allow the Head of Government to take measures to confront the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the normal functioning of essential services for a period of two months. The essential services covered fall into four categories: finance and social services; rights, determination of crimes, offences and contraventions; health and environment; and the functioning of the public and private sectors.'' (5 , 6) 

After the first few months of the exceptional measures in 2020, the ARP returned to its pre-pandemic functioning [3].

 The Turkish Parliament adjourned it’s session for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. On June 4 of 2020, Turkish Parliament resumed its work. On June 26 2020, Parliament was again shut until 30 June 2020 due to Covid-19 cases having been found. On July 2 2020 Parliament reopened, and parliamentary work continued (e.g. the election of the Parliament took place between July 2 and July 12). The Turkish Parliament started its fourth legislative session on Oct. 1 2020 with virus measures amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies. Thus, the government has ruled by decree on a wide set of issues and with no clear demarcation toward only relating to Covid-19 measures. This has been the situation throughout the pandemic, and Turkey has in several instances been criticized for also using overly broad interpretations of what the laws they rely on allow, as well as implementing and announcing measures in ways inconsistent with the regular and established process. Thus, this is coded as 3 for all time periods.

 The health minister is allowed to set up rules to combat covid-19. Breaking these rules is an offence. The parliament operated with limited staff during the lockdown in 2020. By not declaring a state of emergency the oversight role of the parliament is restricted and the executive rules by decree, although it seems to have been limited to pandemic response.

 The parliament performed its legislative functions with MP's working remotely in March-June. Plenary meetings were held physically and the parliament passed laws with emergency measures. According to Democracy Reporting, "The legislative branch of the government continued to function, even though several MPs fell ill with covid-19. As usual, MPs voted on laws during plenary sessions held inside the parliamentary building at 5 Hrushevskoho St. As one of the most significant changes in parliamentary activities during the quarantine, meetings (e.g. hearings) began to be held online. However, there were exceptions to this practice for hearings on high priority issues, some of which were held by MPs outdoors near the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament." (1)

 I found no limitations on the lawmaking role of the legislature in other time periods; the parliament continued to pass laws with emergency measures.

 For health reasons, parliament worked remotely from 26 March 2020 to 21 April in 2020, but have resumed work although with limited number of MPs present at each time. Committees are also working, and the parliament have both amended and passed laws. In addition, claiming urgency, the secreterary of state has the power to make the regulations come into force immediately, but the House of Commons needs to approve them within 28 days or it expires. The House also has the possibility to terminate it at any point before that. The emergency measures have thus not affected the parliaments law making role, and this is coded as 0. Note however that there has been significant critique toward the UK government for the lack of parliamentary scrutiny toward the measures taken, not least financial packages and spending. Furthermore, the system of operating where the government have enacted several measures through declarations in line with the legislation, and which have then only been subject to parliamentary approval after that (and as noted above, expires by itself after 28 days if the parliament has not voted on it). However, given that parliament continues to be involved in this process, it is not regarded as affecting their law making role. Neither is the law making role affected in other circumstances as far as has been found. Their capacity to scrutinize and oversee government actions, especially in terms of debates and referring questions to the government in relation to decisions, has been limited for various reasons (claiming urgency, the relatively few parliamentarians gathered at one point and the like), this does not impact law making directly, but rather relates to parliamentary oversight. This is therefore coded 0.

*Comments*:
 The National Emergency Act, or related emergency measures taken such as under the Stafford Act and Public Health Service Act, do not provide the executive any additional lawmaking power, nor does it limit the legislatures lawmaking role. The National Emergency Act grants the executive access to a number of emergency authority statutes that can be activated. Consequently, only already existing statues are made available, not the capacity to without the legislature create new ones. In addition, no evidence of any de facto changes in the law making role has been found. Congress has been active in related areas as well, for instance passing Covid-19 relief bills, and their work during in terms of other obligations and debating and legislating in other areas seem to be continuing as usual.  Important to note is also that many of the measures in place during the coded period have been enacted by state authorities, and to what extent the law making role has been limited in relation to governors and other authorities is not accounted for here, so any such potential limitation is not included in this question.

After a legislator died from coronavirus and a spike in the cases, the Zambia parliament adjourned sine die for the second time in reference to the Covid-19 pandemic on 21 July 2020. The parliament was reopened for the Fifth session of the Twelfth National Assembly on 11 September 2020.

While the legislature did resume normal functions from September 2020 onward, President Lungu has continued to unilaterally issue decrees concerning Covid-19 restrictions.

On 28 July 2020, the legislature adjurned business to 25 August after members of Parliament and staff had tested positive to Covid-19. On 25 August, the parliament sat for only 20 minutes to swear in a new MP. The legislature was further adjourned to 1 September.


The limits on the legislature from the Civil Protection Notice remain in place - allowing the Minister in consultation with the President - to rule by decree on Covid-19 related measures.
