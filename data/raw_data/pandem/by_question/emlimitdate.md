*Comments*:
 All executive decrees with Covid-19 measures had a limit date upon their issuance. The curfew e.g. was initially issued for a duration of 2 weeks (see 1,2) or 1 month (see 4, 5). See a list of Covid-19 decrees: 6. 

Nevertheless, the legal instruments used did not have a limit date, i.e. there has not been an activation of the legal instrument, nor has the government stated for how long it intends to legislate with decree powers and the Law n° 88-07 of 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail. 

The latest update on the measures includes an extension of the nightly 23:59-04:00 curfew through at least 20 June 2021 across 19 provinces, including Algiers, Oran, Tebessa, and Constantine.The government has eased some other domestic measures (7).

 The initially declared end date was June 17 2020. Within the legal instrument, there's a possibility to extend the period of Biosecurity Emergency indefinetly, but only for three months at a time. On 2020-05-17 it was declared that the measures will be in place for another 3 months, thus ending on the 17th of September 2020. On September 3 2020, it was declared that it is extended to December 17 2020. On December 11th 2020 it was extended to 2021-03-17. On March 2nd, it was extended to 2021-06-17.

*Comments*:
 In the initial announcement, all measures taken within the Covid-19 Law was due to end at 13th of Apri 2020. The Covid-19 Law had an initial end date in itself as well, which was at 2020-12-31. However, by the amendment on September 26 2020, the end date was changed to 2021-06-30. It also added a clause that makes it possible to extend it to 2021-12-31. The end date as of now is still 2021-06-30, and therefore coded for these periods. Note however that the possibility of extenson to 2021-12-31 remains in the text of the law. Since the end date inQ2 of 2020 was still 2020-12-31, this is the date coded here, but as the end date changed in September 2020, the current end date is coded for the rest of the periods.

 The Special Powers Laws (introduced in 27 March 2020, in force from 30 March 2020, see (3) had a time limit of 3 months: 30 June 2020.  After their expiration, the government continued updating the decrees without declaring a new Special Powers Act. All separate decrees had a limit date. 
The government issued on 30 June 2020 a Ministerial Decree ''portant des mesures d’urgence pour limiter la propagation du Covid-19'' (11), which was being used and continuously updated to deal with Covid-19 during Q3 of 2020. This Order had an initial limit date on 31 August 2020.

The Order of 30 June 2020 was amended by Ministrial Order of 18 October 2020, with an initial limit date of 19 November 2020, which was later replaced and updated by a new Ministrial Order of 28 October 2020. This Order was used and was being updated regularly up to 7 May 2021. The Order has an end date of 30 June 2021 (see Art. 28 (7)).

*Comments*:
 There have been different time limits for different measures, and extensions of some of them, but the legal instrument under which these measures are taken has a sunset clause on 31 of March 2021, and this is therefore the date coded here. After this legal instrument expired, it was replaced with a similar but permanent legal instrument which in itself has no end date. However, all measures taken under it have end dates, and the general time limit for each measure is four weeks. Denmark made a larger reopening and relaxing of restrictions on April 21 2021. They are expected to relax some further measures on May 2021, by not extending some measures. The different measures have individual time limits, most of which are currently set to end sometime in June 2021. The restriction on assembly, which is one of the main restrictions, has an expiry date on 2021-09-01 currently (although this is for the restriction of no more than 500 people in one place – the current restriction of no more than 50 people is set to expire on 2021-06-11). As this is a central restriction, which is currently set to be expired in full on 2021-09-01, this is the date coded for Q2 of 2021.  Note however that they can still be extended, and new measures could be reintroduced as well.

 The state of emergency was declared on March 14 for 30 days (legislative decree nº 593), extended on April 12 for 4 days (legislative decree nº 622), extended on April 16 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 631) and extended on April 30 for 15 days (legislative decree nº 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on May 16 for 30 days via executive decree nº 18, but the decree was considered unconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on May 18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree nº 648 from May 30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country. The president then vetoed this decree on June 6, but the legislative overcame his veto on June 11. Bukele tried to define guidelines for reopening the country via the executive decrees nº 31 and 32, which were not approved by the national assembly. The legislative tried to define their own guidelines via the legislative decree nº 661 from June 12, which Bukele also vetoed. The conflict went to the supreme court, which considered the executive decrees unconstitutional because they imposed limits to constitutional rights without legislative approval. They considered the legislative decree legal and that the president should approve it, which he did on August 31, but when it was published, the dates defined in the decree had already passed. This conflict between executive and legislative left an uncertainty in the country. The supreme court annouced that the measures imposed via the executive decree nº 32 would be lifted on August 23 due to their uncostitutionality, and that the executive and the legislative should reach an agreement by then. They didn't, and the country officially reopened on August 24, although legally there wasn't a state of emergency in place since June 15.

*Comments*:
 The declaration of State of Emergency was originally set to end at April 14 2020, but was extended to June 16 2020 when it ended. For measures taking using the Communicable Disease Act, on 17 June 2020 the government extended restrictions on public gatherings until 1 October 2020. During the winter and spring, Finland have adopted numerous measures with different time limits, both nationally and regionally. There was thus no single time limit to present here, especially since Finland has moved more and more toward a regional approach to combat the virus, thus having variation in the restrictions in place. However, Finland has worked toward the goal to relax and remove most restrictions during the summer of 2021 providing the infection rate remains as projected. The government concretized this development into a time plan in April 2021, where they are planning to ease several restrictions significantly and remove limitations on gatherings sometime during June 2021. Since this is the closest to any coherent time limit available, this is set for Q4 in 2020 and Q1 and Q2 in 2021. Note though that several restrictions have already been eased or relaxed, and that all types of restrictions I’ve found has some type of time limit, many of which could differ from the date set for these later periods.

 France lifted the (first) state of emergency on 10 July 2020. The emergency law, initially declared until 24 May 2020, had been prolonged for 2 extra months, until 24 July 2020.
The law lifting the state of emegrency and organizing the transition period was valid between 11 July 2020 and 30 October 2020.  

Due to a second wave of Covid-19, the state of health emergency was re-instituted on 14 October 2020 initially by decree (6), and later on, on 5 November 2020, the Assemblée Nationale voted in favour of extending the state of emergency until 16 February 2021. 
 
The state of health emergency had been extended several times during 2021 and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly, gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (6)

 The state of emergency was initially declared for 15 days. On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. After the new law, all measures and the state of emergency had a 45-day limit, and were being renewed. 

The government has been continuously prolonging - for 45 days each time - the state of health emergency up until June 2021. The latest extension runs through 28 June 2021. Limit days for each quarter:

Q3 2020:  Initially Ordinance No 322 was declared until 15 July (Art.4), but since then was subsequently amended several times where some amendments do not mention an explicit time limit. Since the legal instrument that the measures are based on has a time limit until 1 January 2021  (Article 45 (3)  on "Temporary measures to be taken until January 1, 2021" of the Law of Georgia on Public Health), emlimitdate is coded as 1 January 2021.

 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. The time limit for the restrictions taken under this amendment depends on how quickly the extent of infections drop in each state (and some will not have them imposed if infection rates are low), but the time limit for the amendment being in effect is 2021-06-30.

*Comments*:
 Since March 2020, President Akufo-Addo has issued a series of Executive Instruments, many of which are unavailable in their full-text online (speeches can be found here [1]). Each announcement came with various extensions - usually for one to two weeks - of the previously adopted restrictions. However, speeches often portrayed these as "until further notice", reflecting the President's unchecked power of extension through the IRA.

Since 31 January 2021, new restrictions have been in force without a specific end date [3]. During his last published speech on 28 February 2021, President Akufo-Addo decreed "until further notice, all the restrictions as announced in my last address remain in force, and the Police will continue to ensure compliance by all and sundry. [4]" On 16 May 2021 the president said the restrictions would remain in force "until herd immunity is achieved" [5]. 

This contradicts the Imposition of Restrictions Act, which allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4) [6].

 The legal instrument used to deal with the pandemic- art. 44(1) of the Constitution - does not require an official invocation, and there are no provisions in the Constitution for how long it should be used. The government has not clarified for how long it intends to legislate using art 44(1). 

Nevertheless, each of the provisions taken to combat Covid-19 had an end date (see a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 1). 
The strictest measure, i.e. the nationwide lockdown, was initially declared on 23 March 2020 to last until 6 April 2020 (2), and was eventually lifted on 4 May 2020. The second nationwide lockdown started on 7 November 2020 with a first end date on 30 November 2020 (3). The lockdown was being continuously extended until it was fully lifted on 14 May 2021. 
In Q3 of 2020 no lockdown was in place, but all other measures, i.e. regulations on public gatherings or a night-time curfew, had a limit date (see also 5).

*Comments*:
 The Article 187 of the Constitution defines that the restriction of constitutional rights can last no longer than 45 days at a time [1]. The decree that restricts fundamental rights was extended numerous times via executive decrees, always for a delimited time period [2, 3]. The last extension identified was via the Executive Decree nº PCM-050-2021, which extended the restrictions until May 9, 2021 [4]. However, there curfew measures that are still in place until June 20, 2021 [5]. This suggests that there are additional extensions that have not yet been published on the official website.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong have taken several measures under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. The main one in terms of affecting people’s democratic rights and every day life, and also the one addressed in terms of the start date for the regulations, is the 599G amendment that controls freedom of assembly and movement.  Initially, the 599G regulation was set to exist for three months (ending on June 29 2020), but was then extended and the expiration date for the regulation was set to 2020-12-31. It has again been extended and has the current end date of 2021-09-30. Measures taken within it, such as keeping or easing limitations on public gatherings, are made with shorter time intervals however, often in place around one week at a time. Other measures, such as closing business, has also had time limits, and no major restrictions imposed has been found to not have time limits in place.

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 have had different time limits that have in many cases been extended, but the amendment itself which grants the extraordinary powers to the Health Minister initially had a sunset clause at November 9 2020. However, the sunset clause was debated on October 22 2020, after which it was extended to June 9 2021. On June 4 2021, it was extended until 2021-11-09. Therefore, the end date was 2020-11-09 for the Q2 and Q3 of 2020, and 2021-06-09 for the Q4 of 2020 and Q1  of 2021. The current end date, 2021-11-09, is then coded for Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 The initial end date for the state of emergency was March 26 2020, as the maximum amount of days the government is allowed to declare a state of emergency before they need to renew it is 7 days. This SOE was extended multiple times, and the final extension in Q2 was set to July 2, which is therefore the date recorded in that period. On July 21 2020 a new temporary law regulating SOE's was introduced that gives the government extended powers during it, as well as a right to declare it for longer time periods (see comments and sources under emleglimit for more information). The last end date set for the SoE in Q3 was therefore November 6 2020. In October 2020, the SOE was extended from this date to January 3 2021, and is therefore the date recorded for Q4. It was later extended until 2021-03-21, and again to 2021-05-01 (which was the last extension during Q1 of 2021), and then in April it was extended to 2021-06-29 which is the current end date.

*Comments*:
 The Decree 2020-351 of 23 March 2020 (1) which declared a state of emergency, did not include a limit date, it only mentioned that this measure may be renewed if necessary. 
In some of the later Communiques by the Council of Ministers (see e.g. 2, 3), a limit date and extension fo the state of emergency is mentioned, but it hasn't been found for all. 
e.g. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 04-29-2020: ''The Council adopted a decree extending the state of emergency. This decree, which is part of the implementation of the national response plan to the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, extends the state of emergency declared on 23 March 2020 throughout the national territory, for a new period from 1 to 15 May 2020.'' 
In the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 09-30-2020 it is mentioned that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020, to continue the strategy of targeted screening and to protect patients, vulnerable and exposed people.'' (4). 

The state of health emergency, introduced on 21 January 2021, was initially declared until 28 February 2021 (see 5, 6). On 26 March 2021, the government extended the state of health emergency until 30 June 2021 (7, 8).

 The activation of the Public Health Act on 3 April 2020 did not have a limit date. At the General Powers Section of the Act, it mentions: 
''The Cabinet Secretary may, by notice in the Gazette and in General powers a newspaper with a wide circulation, put in place such measures as may from time to time become necessary to contain and curb the further spread of Covid-19.'' (see 1)

The Public Order (State Curfew) Order Act of 26 March 2020 (2), containing provisions for the countrywide curfew, was initially declared for a period of 30 days. All later extensions of the emergency measures had a limit date. 

The nationwide curfew has been extended several times since its introduction in March 2020 (and never been lifted). It is currently extended through 27 July 2021 (3).

 The initial end date was March 29 2020, but it has subsequently been extended several times. The final extension in Q2 of 2020 was made for four weeks, setting the end date at July 5 2020, and this is therefore the end date recorded for this period. On August 26 2020, the Lebanese government made a longer extension, setting the end date to December 31 2020, thus being the end date for Q3 of 2020. For Q4, the medical state of emergency was extended to 2021-03-31 on 31 december 2020, and is the date coded for Q4. On 2021-03-29, Lebanese authorities extended the end date to 2021-09-30, and this is the current end date set. This is therefore coded for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23(2) of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (8). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October 2020), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April 2020 state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (9). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located.

 The state of emergency expired on July 21 2020 and a revised national health emergency was announced on July 22 2020. The National Health Emergency has not had any time limit or end date in the declaration, nor does the Public Health Law demand one (see paragraph 14). No other evidence of a time limit has been found, and this is therefore not coded.

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1).

The emergency measures under this legal instrument have been amended several times [3,4], most recently on 16 June 2021 [5,6]. Each set of amendments clearly specified the time limit for the measures, most recently until 30 June 2021 [3,4,5,6].

*Comments*:
 Secondary sources typically mention time limits for most measures that have come into effect in Nepal during the Covid-19 pandemic. Researchers for this project were unable to confirm through official versions of the emergency measures because these could not be translated from Nepali prior to publication of the dataset. They are often posted to social media and government websites as scanned images. Therefore, we have decided to code this case a "1" for emlimit because some evidence suggests that time limits exist. However, we are unable to determine the specific limit date for quarters. In addition, the overall legal instrument in use has no time limit.

 For Q2 of 2020, the initial time limit of the Corona Act was 1 month. For the other periods, when using the using "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases) as the main legal instrument, no defined time limit or end date has been found for major restrictions such as limitations on assembly and private gatherings. No time limit has been found on the legal instrument itself either. This is therefore coded 0 for all other periods.

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was initially declared to be in place for two weeks, and did end after some extensions, the last one being set to 2020-06-16. The new emergency legislation, the National Pandemic Act, however is in effect and has no declared end date. This came into force in the late part of Q2 of 2020, and thus accounted for there as well (although the SoE had a declared end date, as noted above). For the Pandemic Act, measures under it can be active as long as a pandemic is declared under it. Therefore, there is currently no time limit to the emergency measures, but there was time limits under the initial state of emergency.

 The first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May 2020, and ended on 11 May 2020, as announced by President Putin.

 In Q2 of 2020, the  amendment was set to end on June 30 2020, and also did so.
For Q3 of 2020, no defined time limit in the decision to limit public gatherings to up to 50 people from 29 March 2020, which applied for this time period. Thus, neither a central restriction nor the underlying legislation had an end date.
For Q4 of 2020, the decision to limit public gatherings to up to 8 people has a 4-week time limit. It came into force on 24 November and was initially set to expire on 22 December 2020. It was extended to 24 January, but subsequently was taken out of effect as the Covid-19 Act came into effect on 2021-01-10.
For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the Covid-19 Act is in use which is a temporary legislation that has an expiration date of 2021-09-30 at the time of writing. It is currently discussed to extend it to 2022-01-31, but no decision has been taken when this is coded.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures (such as 1 August 2020, 1 September 2020), with some measures until 31 December 2020. Some measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister's COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. " (1) There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found). The measures have been in place in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 A State of Public Emergency was declared on March 27, multiple times extended and expired July 22. Another State of Public Emergency was declared on August 5 and expired September 17. The measures based on The Public Health (Dangerous infectious Diseases) Protection Regulations, 2020 "will subsist for a period of 90 days subject to expert review and modification by the Health Minister at anytime", but no end date is mentioned. No later end date has been found, and this is therefore not coded for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well. Note however that Gambia since December 2020 has had few restrictions in place.

 Turkey has implemented several different and gradual measures in its Covid-19 emergency response. These were issued mainly through ministerial circulars, and the end date of most of them could not be found, or was announced later by the Minister of Interior. For instance, Turkey has announced that they will ease their restrictions as of May 2021, but no time limit for the current restrictions are set. This has been the case throughout the coded period, and generally the time limits of various measures have not been set.

 A national emergency under the National Emergency Act can only be declared for a year at a time, but can be extended. President Biden extended the national emergency on 2021-02-11, and it is thus set to end on 2022-03-01 currently. Note that national emergencies can be extended multiple times, and other national emergencies have been in place for several decades in the U.S.

 When declared, the state of emergency was to end on April 12, 2020 [1], but it was extended several times [2]. The lastest extension identified was until March 30, 2021 [3]. However, there are still strict quarantine measures in place, which restrict constitutional rights [4, 5]. This suggests that the state of emergency is still in place. However, the limit date is unknown.
