 Afghanistan's biggest news agency, Pajhwok Afghan News, has been harrassed since it reported on 32 ventilators that were meant for Afghan Covid-19 patients that were stolen and sold to Pakistan in June 2020. The director of the agency was interrogated by representative from the health ministry the day after the report was released. After this report, the Vice-President Amrullah Saleh said in a tweet that the ventilators never went missing. 

I did not find addition cases of de-facto limitations on reporting no the government’s response to the pandemic since june 2020. However this variable has been coded as 1 due to the highly controlled nature of Afghanistans press.

Q4 2020: "On 11 and 12 December 2020, police assaulted and detained Ora News RTV journalist Xhoi Malësia and Kohan Jone newspaper’s editor in chief Qamil Xhani, while they were covering protests in Tirana against police violence. Street clashes erupted in the capital following the death of a 25-year-old man shot by police while enforcing a COVID-linked curfew on 8 December." (Council of Europe, 1) Since such violations are related to the pandemic, merepgov is coded as 1

*Comments*:
 RSF (1): ''Taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis and the resulting halt to the protests, the authorities adopted draconian and vaguely-worded laws in order to clamp down even more on press freedom. Journalists have been prosecuted and convicted for news coverage that is alleged to have “endangered national unity” or “threatened public order and state security”. Several online media have been blocked and are no longer accessible. The harassment is making it very difficult for journalists and media outlets to operate. The authorities are clearly cracking down harder on all forms of dissent as citizens continue to demand more freedoms.'' 

Also, ''In Algeria, state media comes under strict control and censorship, delivering information that has to be first approved by the authorities. In that context, independent platforms such as private media, social media, satellite television and other overseas media represent the main alternative source of information.'' (2). 

'The newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria approved a bill in April 2020 amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.'' (see 3, 4, 5; government Decree: 6). 

Further, the Algerian government adopted in December 2020 its first ever decree governing electronic media. The decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria (2, 7). ''Among the changes brought by this decree, Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain, in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria. Indeed, most, if not all, opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their contributors, who often use nicknames to protect themselves and their families from state harassment.'' (2). This Decree is not directly related to the pandemic, however it affects the general media environment and journalists' reporting. 

Other reports mention that journalists are required to report concrete facts about the impact of the disease. Algerian authorities very quickly introduced red lines on reporting on the daily state of the contagion:  no doctor, hospital director or local health director can announce figures related to Covid-19. Only the National Commission for Monitoring and Surveillance of the Coronavirus Epidemic, composed of scientists, can provide data on the disease. For the government, the objective is to ensure communication that is "as transparent, reliable and credible as possible". Every day at 5 p.m., at a press conference, this commission presents official statistics on the progress of the disease. However, this press conference is not really a press conference, since the spokesperson of this body simply lists the numbers of new cases, recovered patients and deaths.'' (8). 

''At the end of March 2020, the daily El-Sawt-el-Akher published a letter from a member of parliament to the wali of Batna in which he denounced a misdiagnosis by the Algiers Pasteur Institute. According to the deputy, a patient who tested negative for Covid-19 was in fact a carrier of the virus, a situation that would have caused the disease to spread in his locality. After being summoned by the national police, two journalists and the director of this publication were placed under judicial supervision for "undermining national unity" and "distribution of a publication that could harm the national interest" ...'' (8).

Also: ''In a statement on 11 July 2020, the Algerian Minister of Communication accused the media of spreading falsehoods about Covid-19 and threatened journalists with 5 years imprisonment.'' (see 9, 10). 

During Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the Algerian government has been accused of delaying the renewal of press accreditation of foreign media reporters which legally expired on 31 December 2020.
''The authorities have usually been late in the renewing them in the past but there has always been a tacit understanding that reporters can continue working pending receipt of their new accreditation. This tacit understanding no longer seems to be in effect.'' (11). 

FreedomHouse mentions (12): ''In April 2020 the websites of media outlets Maghreb Emergent, Radio M, and Interlignes became unavailable to Algerian users. In August 2020 the website of L’Avant-Garde Algérie also became inaccessible from within the country. Additional news websites were blocked in December, including Tariq News, Shihab Presse, UltraSawt, TSA Algérie, and Twala. Viewers can access unlicensed private television channels located in Algeria but legally based outside the country, though these are subject to government crackdowns.''

 Media freedom is limited in Angola, since several media outlets are controlled by the government and only a few manage to produce independent and critical reporting. The journalists' union accused the public media of not covering demonstrations against the death of an Angolan doctor by police forces after they detained him for not wearing a mask.

 There are reports that journalists are not allowed to enter the province of Formosa to report on the Covid-19 situation. A member of the local government said journalists should "send questions via email" if they wish to know about the situation in the province. Local journalists complain of the lack of public information available and the mistreatment from members of government. These limitations are restricted to one province and there is no indication that the national government limits reporting about their response to Covid-19.

*Comments*:
 In accordance with Decree N 298 (also see melim), the authorities ordered several media outlets to remove or edit information related to covid-19 (both regarding the virus and the government's response).  The media outlets that had to remove information include 1)   “At the request of the police, journalist Marine Kharatyan was forced to remove the post from her Facebook page yesterday, where she told that people have recently been called to work in one of the large factories in Yerevan.” (1)
2)     “Hraparak, was forced to retract a story about complaints by prisoners in Armenian jails that they were no longer permitted to receive parcels from family members. ” (2)
3)     “Etchmiadzin resident complaining that she was ill but hadn’t been properly examined.” (FactInfo Editor-in-Chief Sona Truzyan) (3)
 
Since the measures applied until 13 April, merepgov is coded as 0 in July-September 2020. Since the state of emergency ended on 11 September 2020 and I found no new measures limiting media information, merepgov is coded as 0 in October-December 2020. No evidence was found of limitations from the government regarding COVID-19 in 2021.

 Detention of journalists who criticized the government's response. Examples include:

1) "On April 13, Ibrahim Vazirov, a freelance journalist and blogger with Kanal24 Internet TV, was arrested in the city of Shirvan, days after police had demanded he delete online reports about COVID-19.According to the Interior Ministry, he was arrested for disobeying a lawful request by the police and detained for 25 days. Vazirov had been producing video reports critical of the quarantine measures." (1)

2) On 13 April, "Reportyor.info journalist Mirsahib Rahiloglu was arrested in Shirvan for "violating quarantine rules" and detained for 30 days.He had also been critical of the local authorities and published interviews with citizens expressing frustration at the lack of financial support during the lockdown" (1) 

3)  "On April 9, freelance journalist Natig Izbatov of online news outlet 7gun.az was arrested as he was filming interviews with people about the economic effects of the quarantine during an anti-government protest in Xirdalan, a city near Baku." (1)

Although new information found since June 2020, still coded as 1 as media freedom in Azerbaijan in general is restricted.

IPI reports that: "Over the last decade, Aliyev, who has ruled Azerbaijan since 2003 and won every presidential election with around 80 percent of the vote, has gradually tightened his grip over the media space and overseen the persecution of critical journalists and bloggers. Several have fled the country, while those who remain often self-censor for fear of arrest.The country has one of the highest number of journalists in jail in the region. According to IPI, in addition to those jailed this month [April 2020], five more journalists are currently behind bars." (1)

*Comments*:
 The Bangladeshi government introduced the Digital Security Act in 2018 and this act has been frequently used during the pandemic to stifle press freedom in the country. Under this Act, journalists can be taken to court and punished for ‘spreading rumours and carrying out anti-government activities’. 

Police arrested journalists Tasneem Khalil and Shahed Alam, cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore, writer and blogger Mushtaq Ahmed, and charged 9 others in May 2020 for reporting about and criticizing the government’s response to Covid-19. All of them face life imprisonment under the draconian Digital Security Act.

I did not find instances where the media has faced de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the pandemic in the first two quarters of 2021. However, there have been instances of authorities arresting doctors, opposition activists and students for the comments on the government's response to the pandemic.

 Journalist Siarhei Satsuk was detained on 25 March 2020 based on corruption charges after publishing an article critical of the government's response to the pandemic. Although new information was found since June 2020, still coded as 1 as media freedom in Belarus in general is restricted, and independent journalism has been further limited since the 9 August presidential elections. Numerous articles by the IPI and Reporters without Borders on increasing restrictions on press freedom suggest that media faces de-facto limitations on their reporting, which would apply also to reporting on the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, on 29 August 2020 the government withdrew accrediation of 17 journalists working for "Associated Press, AFP, German television network ARD, Deutsche Welle, Reuters, RFE/RL, Radio France International, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal" (IPI,1). Since 21 August, the government blocked more than 70 websites, including "Radio Svaboda (the Belarusian service of Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty), the site of Belsat (a TV channel run by exile journalists based in Warsaw), the Belarusian sites of The Village and Warsaw-based Euroradio, and the Belarusian version of the Russian alternative media outlet MediaZona." (Reporters without border, 2).

*Comments*:
 No explicit de-facto limitations on reporting about the nature of the Covid-19  were found. 

The media however are ''closely watched'', and have been subjected to close surveillance'', and ''pro-government reporting “guidelines” are often sent to the media after cabinet meetings.'' (1) 

Benin has fallen 36 places in RSF's World Press Freedom Index since 2016 and is now ranked 114th out of 180 countries. 

Also, on 7 July 2020, Benin’s media regulator, the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC), has ordered the immediate closure of all “unauthorized” online media outlets. This decision was taken based on article 252 of Law No. 2015-07 of 20 March 2015 on the Information Code in Republic of Benin, according to which ''the direct or indirect operation in the Republic of Benin for free or against payment of a website providing audiovisual communication and print media services intended for the public, is subject to the authorization of the HAAC.'' (see 6-11). 

After the reactions that this decision provoked, the governemnt made efforts to alleviate the situation and lift the decision to close unauthorized media outlets. (see 12). 

Further, on 10 December 2020, the Parliament of Benin approved the Law No. 2020-35 amending the Digital Code Act (Law No. 2017-20) of 20 April 2018. The Digital Code Amendment Act, 2020, amended 4 articles of the Benin Digital Code, 2018 governing legal aspects of digital activities (15). 

Reporters Without Borders (RSF), among others, are calling for an overhaul of the Digital Law, which has been used to throttle free speech and press freedom. RSF stresses that, although initially portrayed as an “appropriate and reliable tool” for combatting cyber-crime, the Digital Law has been used in practice as an instrument to “threaten the exercise of journalism in Benin.” The Law, adopted in 2018, allows the authorities to prosecute journalists as ordinary citizens as soon as what they say or write appears online.

 A journalist was arrested and jailed for two years in May 2020 for reporting on a person having died of Covid-19, under Article 505 of the Penal Code stating that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public". This legislation evidently puts de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19. Myanmar has also closed down over 200 websites in response to the crisis, many of which were media outlets, claiming that these sites spread "fake news”, a ban that has largely continued throughout the year. Furthermore, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders in place during the fall of 2020, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both Covid-19 and non Covid-19-related news. After the Coup in 2021-02-01 the limitation of media freedom has only been exacerbated, and by now more or less no independent media exists in the country. Journalists are also put on wanted lists, and access to internet and media remains severely restricted by government. While many of these measures are not made with reference to the pandemic, they fully limit any reporting on the pandemic, the governments response and the like. Thus, this is coded as 1 for all periods.

 There are reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on Covid-19 related matters: 

Burundi has been accused for not actively testing or reporting on Covid-19 cases. (1)
'Burundi’s government is failing to communicate fact-based information on the Covid-19 pandemic and preventing doctors and nurses from responding adequately.'' (2) 

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.'' (4) 
However, the media environment has recorded progress during 2020. Burundi moved 13 places, from 160 to 147 in the RSF index, largely following the President's call for the media regulator to "settle the differences" with banned media and a presidential pardon of four journalists sentenced to two and a half years in prison. (3)

 1: Monoroom.info, a Khmer-language news website based in France, became inaccessible in Cambodia on 31 March after it published several articles about the coronavirus situation there. It has remained inaccessible ever since.

The laws and governments increased ability to control the press would hinder the journalists’ abilities to be critical on the government’s response to Covid-19.

2: Journalist Sovann Rithy was sentenced to 18 months in October 2020 for reporting on comments that the Cambodian Prime Minister had publicly made about Covid-19. 

3: Journalist Ros Sokhet was sentenced to 18 months in prison on 11 November 2020 for his criticism on government’s response to Covid-19. 

4:  In May 2021, the Cambodia government banned the media from reporting on Covid-19 related news from 'red zones'. These red zones are areas with high infection rates.

I did not find cases of the media facing limitations on reporting about the government's response to Covid-19 in Q1 of 2021. However the media landscape is heavily controlled and multiple people have been arrested for sharing information about Covid-19 in Cambodia since January 2020. As I did not find any information suggesting that the situation has improved, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 There are many incidents of arrests, harasshment and intimidation of journalists in Cameroon (see 1, 2, 3), and there are incidents regarding media limitations on access to information with reference to Covid-19. 
''The authorities are refusing to provide information about the coronavirus pandemic to several very popular media outlets that are critical of the government.'' 
''Press freedom continues its long decline in Cameroon, now one of Africa’s most dangerous countries for journalists. The government often points to the existence of many media outlets but this doesn’t mean they enjoy a favourable environment. Reporters are often detained arbitrarily and prosecuted, including by military tribunals or special courts.'' (3)

 The media and journalists in CAR face many challenges: ''As the CAR struggles to emerge from the violence of a civil war in which newspaper offices were ransacked and radio stations were destroyed, attacks on the media continue, journalists are still caught between the various warring parties and still in danger, and impunity for crimes of violence against them is total.'' (RSF) 

''As the CAR struggles to emerge from the violence of a civil war that saw radio stations ransacked and destroyed, journalists are still in danger from the various warring factions and attacks on the media continue, including a radio station ransacked in April 2020. Much of the country is not controlled by the state and the authorities are increasingly intolerant of criticism. Journalists who interview the various parties involved in the conflict are often treated as spies or as the accomplices of armed groups, and are often the targets of violence. This was seen again in 2019 when a policeman fired at a journalist in Bouar and violence was used to detain two French reporters in Bangui. The security environment during the presidential election in late 2020 was appalling. Some journalists were directly threatened. Others were pressured by being invited to “participate in the war effort” or by being forced to stay in the capital to cover the armed clashes taking place there. Disinformation campaigns, especially online ones, are increasing in scale and it is not unusual for responsible journalists and bloggers to be the targets of hate messages, defamation and attacks on social media. The vulnerable and easily-influenced print media publish little more than editorials, rumours and smear campaigns. Backed by Switzerland’s Fondation Hirondelle, Radio Ndeke Luka is one of the few media outlets providing properly-sourced reporting in a landscape scarred by years of conflict, but it is often subjected to pressure. When crimes of violence are committed against journalists, there is total impunity...'' (RSF)

*Comments*:
 Overall, reporters in Chad are often arrested because of what they write. There exist charges on defamation and cyber-censorship. Journalists are exposed to the threat of terrorism, and have also been subjected to violence by the security forces. (RSF)

''On 26 March 2020, journalist for state broadcaster Télé Tchad Aly Mahamat Bello, his cameraman Abakar Mahamad Seid and their driver were assaulted and then detained by the Chad Police Mobile Intervention Unit (GMIP) in the capital, N’Djamena, while reporting on government Covid-19 enforcement measures (coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings). The Union of Chadian Journalists said the three were interrogated for three hours before being released.'' (1, 2). 

In addition, Chad's High Authority for Media and Broadcasting (HAMA) asked in September 2020 and October 2020 many independent media outlets to comply with a provision of a law - the 2018 press law - that requires from media editors and publishers to at least have a postgraduate degree in journalism. The HAMA already closed 12 publications – a quarter of the Chad’s privately-owned print media outlets – at the start of September 2020 on the same grounds. 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021 ''Chadian authorities have stepped up restrictions on civic space in recent months with long internet shutdowns, arbitrary arrests, and violations of freedoms of protest and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said ahead of the 11 April 2021 presidential election.'' (7). These are not related to Covid-19 news coverage.

 Many critical voices questioning the government’s management and response to Covid-19 have been silenced. Examples of this are listed below.

1: Reporters Without Borders has reported that Beijing has been using its ambassadors to “launch an all-out attack campaign against media that publish critical stories linked to the pandemic and China”. 

2: Political commentator Ren Zhiqiang disappeared after denouncing the regime’s shortcomings.

3: Three journalists were arrested for publishing information related to the epidemic. 

4: On May 8 2020, New York Times foreign correspondent Chris Buckley, who had spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the pandemic was forced out of China after the authorities refused to renew his visa.

5: Citizen journalists have been gone missing, found to have been detained and ‘formally indicted on charges of spreading false information’. According to reports, these individuals were reporting on Covid-19 – on the prevalence of the virus and the governments response.

6: Journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years imprisonment in December 2020 on the charge of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble" for reporting live from the city of Wuhan during the Covid outbreak.  

I have not found specific instances of de-facto limitations on reporting on the government response to Covid-19 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. However, multiple sources have reported that censorship and media control in China has gotten worse since the start of the pandemic. Hence, I have continued to code merepgov as 1 for both Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 'The media landscape in DRC is characterized by a plethora of ''press freedom violations... including arrests, attacks, threats and ransacking or closures of media outlets''....''The environment for media personnel continues to be extremely hostile..'' (6).

''DRC police deliberately ran down television journalist Tholi Totali Glody in Likasi on 22 March 2020, in the country’s Haut-Katanga province of Glody, who works for Alfajari TV, a local station, and who was reporting on compliance to the lockdown decreed by the provincial government.'' (7).

Also: ''In the DRC, caution can border on self-censorship. “Information on the diversion of public funds for combating the coronavirus has circulated in newsrooms,” says Tshivis Tshivauadi, secretary-general of Journalist in Danger, a Congolese press-freedom NGO  and RSF partner organization. “But journalists who dare to publish this information would risk prosecution.” Congolese media law, adopted in 1996, sets out prison terms, and even capital punishment, for some press crimes.'' (8) 

According to the HRW world report 2020 (1), ''Dozens of people who criticized government policies, including on social media, were intimidated and threatened, beaten, arrested, and in some cases prosecuted. Particularly targeted by authorities across the country, journalists faced threats and harassment, and some broadcast programs or outlets were shut down upon instructions from officials.'' (see also 2, 3). 

''Journalism continues to be a dangerous profession in the DRC. In Mongala province, Equateur’s immediate neighbour, Radio Liberté Lisala director Erick Ngunde was arrested on 13 February 2021 after hosting a programme about political tension in the province. Although now released, he has been suspended from working as a journalist. In the eastern city of Goma, Radio UB-FM reporter Nanou Kazaku sustained a gunshot injury while covering a demonstration on 17 February 2021. (4)

''The human rights situation in the DRC has reportedly deteriorated under president Felix Tshisekedi’s watch. His administration is accused of increasingly cracking down on the media and activist groups during its two years in office. In January 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that at least 109 cases of arbitrary arrests and harassment had been recorded over the past year. Many victims were journalists, who faced intimidation, threats, and sometimes beatings.'' (5)

In February, 2021, the Ministry of Health declared that journalists were not allowed to cover the administration of the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Shortly after the Minister of Health was replaced for the poor management of the vaccination program.

 There has been restrictions on the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

1: Ruth Michaelson, a journalist writing for The Guardian who had been living and working in Egypt had to leave the country after she reported on research suggesting that Egypt had a higher rate of coronavirus infections than reported by the government. 

2: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

3: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

4: At least ten doctors and six journalists have been arrested between February and July 2020. Health workers have also been instructed to refrain from discussing the situation regarding Covid-19 with the press. The Supreme Council has also made multiple announcements threatening legal action against members of the media who report on the government's response to Covid-19 in a negative manner.

I have not found new cases of de-facto limitations on reporting on the government's response to Covid-19. However multiple organizations such as Reporters without Borders and Amnesty International have continued to report on how the press in Egypt continued to be tightly controlled partially due to the pandemic. Given the highly controlled nature of the Egyptian press, I have continued to code this variable as 1 across all the time periods.

 In April 2020 the authorities  detained a lawyer, Elizabeth Kebede, and charged a journalist, Yayesew Shimelis, for comments on social media about the government’s response to the coronavirus. Another journalist was held for three weeks without bail for "spreading false news" in March and April 2020. 
Article 3:6 of the State of Emergency Declaration limits media freedom as it states: "Disseminating rumors or information that is likely to create confusion or panic among the public is prohibited." Article 4:5 also limits media freedom: "Government and private media shall ensure that information and news on COVID are not exaggerated or underreported, are sufficient and are not likely to create panic." This declaration went into effect on  April 11, 2020 and ended September 8, 2020.
After the State of Emergency ended, there have apparently not been de-facto limitations on the media for reporting on the government's response to the pandemic.

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS of 10 April 2020 (1), designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to Covid-19, does not exempt journalists and the media from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures. 

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by June 2021.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid-19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation.

 On 16 December 2020, ''leading Greek journalist Dimitra Kroustalli said that she had been forced to resign from her post at the newspaper To Vima following “strangling pressure” from the cabinet of the Greek prime minister over a damaging report she wrote about the flaws in the systems used to track and monitor Covid-19 cases.'' (2, 3).

In February 2021, public TV channels were ordered not to broadcast video circulating on social media that showed the prime minister disregarding lockdown rules. (4) 

Overall, the greek media landscape has worsened significantly in 2020. Greece now ranks 70 compared to 65 a year ago in the RSF index. After New Democracy's party victory in the July 2019 general election, public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA were placed under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis through a presidential decree. Ever since, the Greek government has ''sought, directly or indirectly, to control the flow of information closely as part of its efforts to deal with both the coronavirus pandemic and the refugee crisis.'' (6). 

''Media in Greece rank among the least trusted by the public, compared to other countries in Europe.... a combination of ownership issues, drastic cuts in costs and jobs, and a peculiar relationship to political power, has produced a deeply problematic media landscape, where unbiased, dispassionate coverage is hard to find....During Covid-19, the partisanship of Greek media played out even more intensely. Stories about government contracts that were handed out in less than clear circumstances were featured only in a handful of independent, alternative outlets. Scrutiny over how the government would meet the challenge of building up a public healthcare system devastated by years of cuts was likewise absent from the majority of the media. Questions over the government’s implementation of safety protocols for travelers from abroad were largely unasked...'' (1).

Throughout the pandemic, journalists had to get the government’s permission before reporting in hospitals on Covid-19 issues, and the health ministry banned medical staff from talking to the media.(6)

In addition, when the Greek government allocated a controversial 20-million-euro public information campaign about the virus, investigative media and outlets critical of the government received less than 1 percent of the total sum, compared to pro-government outlets, and one particularly anti-government outlet was excluded entirely from the funding (1, 6).

 No evidence of limitations related to Covid-19 was found. 
The media are criticized by the President Alpha Conde and the authorities periodically try to censor critical media. 
Three websites, Le Lynx, the Guinée Matin newspaper’s website and Aminata.com, were suspended or threatened with suspension during the October 2020 elections (1). 

According to the US Department of State's 2020 report on human rights practices, ''The government penalized media outlets and journalists who broadcasted items criticizing government officials and their actions. Some journalists accused government officials of attempting to influence the tone of their reporting.'' (2) 

However, these violations are unrelated to Covid-19.

However, ''In April 2020, the CPJ called on Haitian authorities to investigate an assault on a group of journalists in Port-au-Prince. CPJ reported that several unidentified men punched and hit a group of eight reporters at the National Identification Office, a government department that manages citizens’ identification cards. The journalists were there to report on claims that the office was not adhering to guidelines on social distancing.''
Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security”.  (2, 3).

*Comments*:
 There are several restrictions to media in Hong Kong, especially through the National Security Law imposed on June 30 2020. In Q2 of 2020, the media in Hong Kong faced multiple limitations in its reporting, for example illustrated by the arrest of media owner Jimmy Lai in April 2020. While these restrictions mainly pertained to the pro-democracy protests, it is here regarded as constituting such overall limitations that reporting on the governmetns response to Covid-19 should be affected as well. And after the implementation of the National Security Law, which criminalizes speech and press that could "interfere", "disrupt" or "undermine" the Hong Kong and Chinese government, this constitutes an even greater de facto limitation on media. The implementation of this has continued throughout the coded period, and the media freedom in Hong Kong remains very limited. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 According to IPI, the "fake news" law has increased self-censorship for journalists who are afraid of being charging with spreading false information. Moreover, "journalists could hardly find sources in the health care system or education system who were willing to talk. There is a definite fear among ordinary people from the consequences of leaking." (1)

 1: There have been attempts to censor at least one local newspaper about the effects of the lockdown on poor neighborhoods.

2: The editor of one of the most widely circulated Bengali language newspaper was speculated to have been forced to step down after he reported on the shortage of Personal Protection Equipment for the doctors treating Covid-19 patients.

On April 2021, the Indian government, asked Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to take down more that 100 posts that were critical to the government's response to the pandemic. And on 23 April 2021, the government blocked more than 50 tweets from people who were critical of the governments handling of the pandemic.

Given the general restricted nature of the media environment in India (RSF ranks India 142 out of 180 countries), we can assume that limitations on media reporting about the government response continue to exist even if such incidences are not widely reported.

 There have not been government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting.

However, On April 4, 2020, the National Police Headquarter issued a Telegram Letter instructing the police on the handling of “hoax spreaders” and any act of insult to the President and his administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the police authority, this telegram letter is officially aimed at maintaining the security and order of the community. The telegram ordered the police force to carry out cyber patrols to monitor developments in cyberspace and to counter criminal acts to provide a deterrent effect (1). 

So far, there have been at least 57 people accused of spreading “false news” and insulting the President and his administration related to COVID-19. There are concerns on the possibility of criminalization towards more people who spread “false and misleading” information as well as criticize the Government’s response to COVID-19(1).

This regualtion also goes against Article 28 of the Indonesian Constitution which quarantees the right to free speech (3). 
 
I have not found additional instances of the government placing de-facto limitation on media reporting. But since the issues outlined above are still in place, i have continued to code this variable as 1 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 There are several reports on journalists being arrested for reporting on the coronavirus, especially those who have published evidence that contradicts the governments figures about the spread of the virus and accused the Iranian government of misinformation about the Covid-19 situation in Iran. These Journalists have generally been accused of "Publishing false information about the coronavirus". A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce. Since this reporting includes the prevalence of the virus, this is included in the government response. Beyond that, the media in Iran is severely restricted in several ways and journalists are arrested and jailed for numerous reasons, generally limiting the capacity for reporting, including on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1.

 There are several reports of journalists being arrested and detained for investigating and reporting on Covid-19, for example its prevalence and protests held in relation to emergency measures. In early April 2020, the commission suspended Reuters license and fined it 25 million IQD (US$21,000) for an April 2 article alleging that the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country was much higher than official statistics indicated. The authorities lifted the suspension on April 19 2020. The Reuters report, published on April 2 2020, cited three doctors involved in the testing process, a health ministry official and a senior political official as saying Iraq had thousands of confirmed COVID-19 cases, many times more than the 772 it had publicly reported at that time. In November 2020, journalists (and bloggers) were also charged with defamation cases for investigating the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. In addition, several journalists have been arrested for covering protests related to the Covid-19 handling of the pandemic and the economic consequences, and two were sentenced to several years in prison in February 2021.  There are also vaguely formulated defamation laws and similar regulation (e.g. Article 433 of Iraq’s Penal Code) that Iraqi authorities can prosecute media and individuals of breaking, that constitutes a de facto limitation. This is therefore coded as 1.

Finally, the Jordanian media also faces more general limitations, such as a crack down on their coverage of government protests during the summer, and the issued ban on spreading “rumours, fabrications and false news that sows panic” which is part of the emergency response and ongoing as far as I’ve found. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

Police in the western city of Atyrau arrested journalist Beken Alirakhimov and cameraman Manas Sharipov of KTK TV as they were interviewing doctors and reporting on working conditions at a hospital in the city. The pair were charged with "violating the state of emergency" under Article 476 of the Administrative Code. They were found guilty on April 24 and were placed under forced quarantine for two weeks in hospital." (1, IPI) Because of existing legislation limiting media freedom, merepgov is coded as 1 in all time periods.

 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities attempting to de-facto limit reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the government preventing media access to information about the coronavirus.

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September 2020), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1, 2)

''About 60% of these cases were related to lack of access to public information or restricted from accessing various open places to interrogate and provide objective and critical reporting on the Counties Covid-19 preparedness. In 7 cases, government officials unjustifiably denied journalists access to crucial information or interviews as part of their role of interrogating the country’s Covid-19 preparedness.'' (2)

''Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media's job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. ''Trust and obey'' has seemed to be the overriding message.'' (3)

 The authorities have targeted the dissemination of “false information”, and investigated several websites for spreading false information. For example, “In April the Ministry of Information announced that it had referred 25 websites to the Public Prosecutor, mostly for “offending the government” over its handling of COVID-19.” (1) The Ministry of Information has been “monitor[ing] websites and news services that broadcast lies and rumors and provoke sedition” (2). This thus constitutes a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, and coded 1 for all periods.

 No information on limitation of media reporting on the government's response.  Nevertheless, the government has placed many limitations on media reporting in general.

According to Human Rights Watch, In Kyrgyzstan, "neither independent media outlets nor lawyers have been granted permits to pass police checkpoints, interfering with their ability to do their jobs"; Kyrgyzstan has " threatened criminal sanctions or opened investigations into people for spreading “false information” about the virus, including doctors concerned about inadequate protective equipment." "in Kyrgyzstan, Human Rights Watch found that the State Committee on National Security (GKNB) either posted or distributed among media outlets photographs and personal information of at least 27 people it accused of “spreading knowingly false information” about the virus. In most cases, the agency said that the person was released after apologizing to the public, but that the agency “reminds people that spreading false information provides for criminal liability."

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11). This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 in Laos, by making it punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes. No evidence has been found that this regulation having been repealed or amended. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 in Lebanon, and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion in August 2020 introduced far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon) This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

 Several instances of journalists being harassed have been reported. One example is a journalist that was attacked by LDEA agents with the apparent aim of preventing him from reporting that around 100 people attended the wake in violation of a ban on large gatherings.
There are further reports of journalists getting attacked and arrested, however, these instances are not connected to the reporting about Covid-19 and/or the governments response.
"In Liberia, the justice authorities have threatened to close down or seize any news organization that publishes what they consider to be false information." (1)
There is much less reporting on the media situation in Liberia after Q2 of 2020, and the de jure limitation in place on media under the state of emergency seem to have ended when the state of emergency ended on 2020-07-21. The US state department in their human rights report also report that media in Liberia is relatively free, although issues such as self-censorship and government-owned media outlets exist. From the evidence found on this after the end of the limitation to media freedom under the state of emergency, there is not any limitations in place that indicates this should be coded as 1. This is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 and onwards, as no evidence of any limitations to reporting on the governments Covid-19 response has been found after the end of the state of emergency.

 According to the US Department of State's 2020 report (2), 
''In accordance with the constitution, the law restricts individuals’ ability to criticize the government publicly. The government arrested journalists and activists who publicly denounced the misbehavior of public figures. The government often used unrelated charges to prosecute these journalists and activists. Most government actions to restrict freedom of expression occurred within the context of the national response to Covid-19, with journalists arrested or harassed for reporting failures of government officials to combat the disease effectively.''  

Apart from the de-jure limitations, in Madagascar the authorities have banned radio phone-in programmes in which listeners could express their views about the pandemic and the way the government is dealing with it:
''Amnesty International calls on the authorities to stop using the measures to address Covid-19 as a pretext to sanction media outlets, opposition figures or anyone critical of the government's actions.'' (1)

Another report (5) accused Madagascan government on an act of sabotage that has silenced an opposition TV channel and to guarantee journalistic freedom:
''Publishing director and journalist at the Ny Valosoa newspaper Arphine Helisoa was arrested and put in pre-trial detention on 4 April after she was accused of criticizing the president's handling of the national response to Covid-19 in an article. She is still in detention in Antanimora prison in the country's capital Antananarivo. She was charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina.''

The Madagascy authorities announced in October 2020 that all radio programs could resume their live call-in programs.''(2). However, no evidence was found on whether authorities stopped these practices after the state of emergency was lifted on 18 October 2020. 

The state of health emergency was reintroduced on 3 April 2021 and is in place at least until 28 June 2021. Under the state of health emergency, the Ministry of Communication and Culture is given extraordinary poewrs to control information regarding the pandemic. (2) 

On 22 April 2021, Malagasy authorities issued an interministerial decision that suspended the broadcasting of nine radio and audiovisual programs. The programs were suspended under the state of emergency, on the grounds that they were ''likely to disturb public order and security and harm national unity " (3, 4).

 Journalists have been both arrested and jailed for reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 during both the Mar-Jun and Jul-Sep period. The Oct-Dec period has not seen incidents of arrests as far as have been found, but the legislation is still in place and continues to constitute a de facto limitation. This is therefore coded as 1 for all three periods.

On 12 March 2021, issued an "anti-fake news" emergency ordinance. With this instrument, the government is able to "effectively ban any information about the pandemic or current state of emergency that is not its liking". With this, the government is able to choose the information about the pandemic and state of emergency that is released and not released to the public. This adds another layer to the de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to Covid-19 [1,2,3].

 During Q2 of 2020: ''In Mali, the police briefly arrested a reporter for the L’Indépendant newspaper in connection with a report on the epidemic.'' The article does not specify whether the report on the epidemic was about the nature of Covid-19 or the govenrment response (4). 

''On 18 December 2020, the transition government declared a state of emergency related to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a letter sent from the Ministry of Territorial Administration to regional and local authorities, this state of emergency granted authorities the power to take “all necessary measures” to control the press, social media, and all nature of publications, including radio and television broadcasts.'' (1) 

''Malian journalists are protesting orders by the transitional administration that they see as suppressing freedom of the press in the West African country.In a protest meeting of media workers on 20 December 2020, the Union of Free Radio and Television (URTEL) rejected these measures, stressing that "in the name of the fight against the coronavirus disease, we will never accept from anyone the questioning of essential freedoms, including freedom of the press".'' (2). 
''In a statement, the Malian Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, explained that "contrary to some interpretations in the media, the instruction of 18 December 2020 is only an update of an instruction dating from 2015 declaring a state of emergency on the national territory".'' (2, 3). 

The state of emergency is still in place until 26 June 2021.

 On 2 June 2020, the police arrested Salma Mint Tolba, the alleged author of a series of audio recordings questioning aspects of the government's response to the Covid-19. Notably, she accused the authorities of inflating the number of infections.'' (1) 

On 24 June 2020, the National Assembly approved a new law - the Law on Combatting Manipulation of Information - aimed at prohibiting allegedly false news posts on social media. The Law states as its objective to prevent manipulation of information, publication of false news, and the creation of fake digital identities ''especially during periods of elections and during health crises'', like the Covid-19 pandemic. Penalties for violations range from three months to five years in prison, and fines from 50,000 to 200,000 Ouguiya (US$1,325-5,300) (2, 3; see also 4 - 6). 
Many opposition parliamentarians as well as human rights activists denounced the law, declaring that it risks undermining the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution (3).

 In May, a journalist received a fine after reporting on "unsafe working conditions and lack of disinfectant inside their textile factory during Covid-19" (2) in a textile factory on Facebook (since she is a journalist, making a social media post is considered journalism). As IDEA reports, "Journalist Natalia Cebotari was intimidated, harassed, and fined 123 euro over a Facebook post reporting on unsafe and unhygienic working conditions in a textile factory. She also faced pressure from authorities to reveal her sources." (1)

 IPI reports that "the country’s Security and Intelligence Service (SIS) also ordered 52 different websites allegedly disseminating fake news about the coronavirus to be blocked."(2)  The official press release says that the blocked websites are not officially registered news agencies and contains no other information on the content, therefore this is not considered in the coding.  Since it is a single incident and no further information has been found, merepgov is coded as 1 only in March-June 2020 period.

As "false information" is poorly defined, and this law is being enacted and journalists and media outlets face the risk of being prosecuted for "disseminating false information", this is coded as 1, a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 is made as journalists and media outlets now that they can be fined on a vaguely formulated regulation on disinformation.
Since the law is still in place, this is coded 1 for all three periods.

 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of Covid-19.

With the Decree No. 2-20-292 of 23 March 2020 (1, 2) on special provisions for a State of Health Emergency, the government is enabled to ... take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).'' (3)

Also, in a statement on 22 March 2020, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news (see 5 in arabic). The Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions starting on 26 May 2020 (6). 

In addition, on 19 March 2020, the Government Council approved draft law No. 22.20 on the use of social networks, open broadcasting networks or similar networks, which, according to the Minster of Justice, aims at combatting fake news. After a large wave of critiques and denouncements by civil society organisations on the absence of consultations and the lack of transparency regarding the content of the provisions, since the draft law was only discovered in detail on 27 April 2020, following a leak on social networks, the bill was temporarily suspended on 4 May 2020 (4).

 Namibia is one of the highest ranked countries for press freedom in Africa and ranks 24 globally according to Reporters Without Borders [1]. No incidents were found that showed limits on reporting about the government's response, although see comments under Limitations on Access to Information (meinf).

 There have been multiple reports of journalists being penalised for reporting on the governments response towards Covid-19 in a negative manner in Q2 2020.

1: "Lok Karki, a reporter for Radio Dhangadhi was detained for six days in Doti district while reporting on mismanagement of food distribution and relief items during Covid-19 lockdown." [2]
 
2: "Pramita Dhakal, a journalist for Kantipur daily, was detained for three hours by the police while she was taking photographs of vehicles seized during lockdown in Chitwan district." [2]

3: "Radio Dhangadi reporter Nabaraj Dhanuk was allegedly attacked by an elected representative of a local area following a news broadcast about embezzlement of Covid-19 funds allegedly committed by the politician. Supporters of the politician also picketed outside the radio station. The journalist had interviewed the politician about discrepencies in distribution of aid." [2]

I have not found new cases of the media facing de-facto limitations on reporting about the government's response to Covid-19.

 The government is not transparent about the situation and does not share the real number of cases, deaths, or tests. There were police officers by the hospitals to prevent journalists from filming or speaking with health professionals. Several burials happened during the night, so citizens wouldn't know and journalists could not report about them. Additionally, the government has blocked independent media and international press from participating in press briefings.

 ...''there has been little change in the overall environment for the media and journalists. In a regional context marked by the fight against terrorism, visits by journalists to the most dangerous areas are still limited, and it is very hard to get information about terrorism or migration. Both Niger's authorities and certain international organizations are responsible for the restrictions on the release of information.'' (2)

''on 25 March 2020, Kaka Touda, an independent journalist who publishes news reports on his Facebook and Twitter pages, In Niger's capital Niamey, was arrested for his social media post about a suspected Coronavirus case in a local hospital, which filed a complaint against him. The hospital said in the complaint that the March 4 social media post posed a threat to law and order.'' (3) 

Also: ''Niger police interrogate TV editor and journalist over interview, 14 March 2020: Judicial police in Niger summoned the editor-in-chief and a journalist of Television Labari, following an article the outlet published which interviewed a prominent veterinarian about the Covid-19 pandemic.''  (4) 

Also, according to Amnesty's 2020 report, ''Journalists in Niger were harassed for criticizing the governments’ response to Covid-19.'' (1)

 Several journalists have been harassed, arrested, and had their cameras taken or destroyed while covering lockdown enforcements and other government covid-19 measures. On 03 August a journalist was attacked by police forces while covering officers enforcing COVID-19 restrictions.  On 24 October, a journalist was arrested after conducting "interviews in the north Lagos suburb of Agege, where residents had massed outside a government warehouse with the aim of taking food they believd to be stored here for alleviating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic" (1), and a week later he was found dead with a gunshot on his body.

Some states have passed a new law, prohibiting publishing "false and damaging" information, which puts limitation on reporting on Covid-19, including on the government's response to Covid-19. In 2021 the media environment continues to harass and arrest journalists.

 I did not find information on de-facto limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic in North Korea. 

However, North Korea is notorious for its highly controlled media prior to the pandemic. North Koreans can be sent to concentration camps for viewing, reading or listening to content provided by media outlets outside the country. As the information coming into the country is also very strictly controlled, it would be difficult for North Koreans to compare responses and form an opinion on the North Korean government’s response towards the pandemic.

Independant media is prohibited and the government regularly uses arrest, punishment of crimes and torture in custody and executions to maintain fear and contol over the population. 

These restrictions which have been in place since before the pandemic, would act as de-facto limitations on the ability of the media to report on the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As such I have coded this variable as 1 across all the time periods.

Note that there has been debate regarding Norway during Q1 and Q2 of 2021 not exempting journalists from the mandatory quarantine of 10 days when entering the country, which in practice limits international journalists covering news in Norway. However, as this does not influence the reporting on media and journalists based in Norway, this is not accounted for.

 Two Pakistani journalists were beaten while in detention for three days in Pakistan's Balochistan province. They were reporting on the lack of basic necessities at a coronavirus quarantine centre in June 2020. 

This coupled with the generally controlled press, continued crackdown on press freedom and dissenting voices in Pakistan could cause the media to face continued de-facto limitations on reporting on the government’s response to the pandemic. As the media situation does not seem to have improved in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 PNG passed the National Pandemic Act which under Section 47 states that ”A person commits an offense if the person … knowingly gives false or misleading information, or … recklessly disseminates false or misleading information to the public in relation to a Public Health Emergency”. Being found guilty of any of the offenses under Section 47 (which includes other offenses as well) can result in penalties of fines up to 50 000 Kina, and imprisonment for up to five years. This clearly constitutes a limitation to reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, and is coded 1 for both periods. The law is still in use and a pandemic is still declared under it, and this is therefore coded 1 or all periods.

2: Two journalists based in Cavite, south of Manila are facing the possibility of jail time and/or fines due to the law stated above for accusing the government of lack of transparency with regards to Covid-19.

I did not find new cases of the media facing de-facto limitation on reporting about the government response to the pandemic. However the general media situation in the country has only worsened in the past year. Furthermore the bill mentioned above would act as a strong deterrent discouraging journalist from being critical of the government's response to the pandemic. Hence, I have continued to code this variable as 1 across all the time periods.

 There is a score of privately-owned TV stations in Congo, a similar number of newspapers and around 40 radio stations, but all are under strong pressure to censor themselves and many are owned by government allies. Since 2014, several journalists have been threatened, forced to flee the country or summarily deported for criticizing the government or inviting opposition politicians to express their views. During the 2016 presidential election, the Internet was disconnected to prevent journalists and activists from verifying and challenging the results.'' (1) 

State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about Covid-19 pandemic: 
''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government's figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown's economic and social consequences.''

 According to Reporters without Border, at the end of March "the regional online newspaper Magadan Govorit was forced to delete a story at the start of the week about the death of a patient suspected of having the virus who finally tested negative. The newspaper said its information was reliable and verified, and did not give the cause of death. Roskomnadzor nonetheless insisted on its deletion."  (1)

According to CPJ, "On June 9, a court in the central Russian city of Ufa fined Timur Almaev, chief editor of independent news website ProUfu, 60,000 rubles ($862) after the outlet published a story alleging that one thousand graves were dug in Ufa for possible victims of COVID-19... police in the town of Sivirsky, outside St. Petersburg, questioned Tatyana Voltskaya, a reporter with the U.S. Congress-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, over an April 11 report for the broadcaster that alleged hospitals lacked the supplies to respond to the pandemic. Authorities opened an investigation into that article on April 25, and allege that Voltskaya was “spreading false news,” she said. If charged and convicted, she could face a fine and up to five years in jail under the Russian criminal code."  (2) Another journalist, Aleksandr Pichugin, was fined for spreading "false information" because of a satirical post on Covid-19 restrictions.

The government passed ammendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code (on spreading disinformation) which was used to censor reporting on the government's handling of the pandemic.  According to IPI, "On March 19, the country’s media regulatory agency, Roskomnadzor, which has a history of censoring the independent press, demanded that more than 20 media outlets remove content it deemed “inaccurate, socially significant information” about the coronavirus from their websites. Among them was radio station Echo of Moscow, which was pressured to remove the recording and transcript of an interview with a disease expert who criticized the government’s handling of the health crisis." Moreover, "media outlets will also be fined up to €117,000 if they publish disinformation about the outbreak, raising further concerns that the broadly defined law will be used to target media that criticize the government’s response to the outbreak."

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures and particularly the lockdown of 21 March 2020 (1) did not exempt journalists from moving freely to work, as it did not include the media in the essential services that are exempted from the movement restrictions. The lockdown was eased in May 2020, but after a rise in coronavirus cases it is since then being re-imposed in selected areas.

Also, the media in Rwanda are facing cernsorship, foreign journalists are often unable to obtain accreditation, and self-censorship is widely implemented (2). 

Particularly during Q2 of 2020, several incidents took place in Rwanda, that reveal a widespread problem of de-facto limitations on reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic: 

''Police in Rwanda, in April 2020, arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s Covid-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.'' (3). 

In March and April 2020, six bloggers were arrested in Rwanda for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.'' (4, 5). 

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

 While no reports have been found on specific instances or measures of censoring or other limitations of the media reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, the already existing, strong limitations on media in Saudi Arabia should constitute a significant de facto limitation on them reporting on Covid-19. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on 30 June 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.'' (1) 

Further, ''After several years of discussion, a new press code was adopted 2017 but the required implementation decrees have yet to be signed. Two bills were nonetheless submitted to the cabinet in early 2021. The new code disappointed journalists because it failed to decriminalise press offences and because it provides for the confiscation of equipment and material and even the closure of media outlets for threats to state security. Press freedom violations, some of them by the security forces, were registered in 2020. Certain stories with a religious link can still be taboo. The headquarters of the newspaper Les Echos were ransacked after it reported that a Muslim religious leader had caught Covid-19.'' (5) 

''Journalists in Senegal say they have rarely experienced as much intimidation as they have since opposition leader Ousmane Sonko was detained for several days earlier this month, sparking unrest that claimed five lives.
Media rights groups have accused the government of clamping down on the press to quash the protests.'' (4) 

Also, in March 2021, during  the protests that emerged when opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, a leading rival to President Macky Sall, was arrested and accused of rape, Senegal experienced an internet and social media shutdown: 
"Network data from the NetBlocks Internet Observatory confirm the disruption of social media and messaging apps in Senegal as of 5 March 2021. Metrics show that Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and some Telegram servers were restricted on leading cellular network operator Orange/Sonatel as of early morning Friday. Affected services have subsequently been restored from 7:30 a.m. UTC," reads a statement by NetBlocks.'' (6)

*Comments*:
 The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) was introduced enacted on 1 April 2019. This law allows members of the government to control information circulating online. The law allows every government minister to issue directives to censor, correct or block access to online content that the government deems to be the “in the public interest”. 

This law has been used to correct several posts that have been made by the public on both the prevalence of Covid-19 and to critic the government’s response to Covid-19. This could act as a deterrent for journalists to be critical of the government's response to the pandemic.

1: POFMA was invoked against five online media platforms after these media platforms used statements from Paul Tambyah, an opposition politician and infectious diseases expert in a forum at the National University of Singapore. This correction direction was issued after he accused the ministerial committee in charge of tackling Covid-19 of losing their focus on public health and instead prioritising the upcoming general election that was carried out in July 2020.

There has only been one other documented use of POFMA in Q1 and Q2 of 2021. It was used to correct speculations of a 'Singapore variant' of Covid.

However as the general media environment continues to be heavily regulated, I have continued to code this variable as 1 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 The overall media reporting environment in Somalia is constrained by criminal code provisions that allow the government to harass and intimidate reporters [1].

Throughout 2020 and 2021, the government used the criminal code to limit media reporting on its response to Covid-19. In July 2020, a regional court sentenced a journalist to six months on charges of insulting a government body while reporting about the government's response to Covid-19 [3].

 1: While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists (1).

2: Sri Lanka's media environment has been heavily controlled and censored before the pandemic. Several activists and journalists are on the government 'watch lists' (3). 

3: Journalists have also fled the country. An example is Dharisha Bastians. The former editor of the Sunday Observer left Sri Lanka after 'her telephone records were publicized and her laptop seized by the authorities' (3).

I have not found new examples of the media facing de-facto limitations on reporting on the nature of Covid-19. However, given the the frequency of the previous cases and Sri Lanka's restricted media environment,  I have coded this variable as 1 across all the time periods.

 Under the transitional government, the media environment in Sudan remains constrained due to the fact that draconian laws from the previous regime remain in effect. According to Reporters without Borders, registration of new media outlets remains restrictive to pro-government voices and many media houses engage in self-censorship [1]. This is further constrained by the adoption of an amendment to the Cybercrimes Act in July 2020, which increased penalties for vaguely worded offenses such as spreading false news or indecent materials. That same month, the army appointed a special commissioner to bring suits against those who "insult" the military online [2]. In May 2020, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported that two journalists had been harassed and arrested for reporting about the number of Covid-19 deaths [3].

(1)Media reporting has been further limited due to new regulations on "false information". According to Reporters without Borders, "Under the amendments to the Administrative Code voted by the Tajik parliament on 10 June, anyone providing  “false” or “inaccurate” information about Covid-19 in the media or on social media could be fined up to 1,160 somoni (995 euros) – nearly twice the minimum monthly wage."

 The government effectively controls the information that is published, and media has faced de facto limitations in reporting on Covid-19. The Mwananchi newspaper was banned from publishing online and and fined 5 million shillings, for 6 months, for having reported critically about the president's actions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Three TV operators - Star Media, Multichoice Tanzania and Azam Digital Broadcast - were fined and were ordered to broadcast an apology for seven days in a row for carrying a report that described the President as 'stubborn' for refusing to impose a general lockdown.
On 10 August 2020, the Tanzanian government announced that broadcasting foreign content would be banned without government permission. This includes content about Covid-19.
 While the new President Hassan in March 2021 stated that the government would remove any media bans in effect, a government spokesperson later stated that this only applied to online television outlets. Furthermore, no evidence has been found of concrete improvements in the media environment since President Hassan’s statement. As the bans made under the Magufuli administration at least seem to have applied during April of 2021, and possibly further as no evidence of improvement has been found, this is coded 1 for all periods.

 Thailand's media landscape has been restricted since before the pandemic. Government critics have been punished by draconian legislation. 

1: Any information about the virus that the government deems to be ”false or capable of causing fear in the public” is not punishable by up to five years in prison. There is also no definition of what constitutes ‘false’ information.

2: The media in Thailand is heavily controlled. There are laws in place that punish people being critical of the government and monarchy both in the press and in social media. The government has also banned a TV channel due to their critical reporting. 

These restrictions would act as a deterrent for journalist to report on the situation in Thailand in a negative or critical manner. Hence I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 There are reports of attempts at censoring journalists who investigate corruption cases, but explicit evidence of limitations on reporting on Covid-19 could not be found (1, 2, 3). 

According to RSF, ''The development of an investigative journalism culture is being held back by the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication, a media regulator whose lack of independence is clear from the way it harasses, prosecutes and imposes sanctions that have included suspending one newspaper after another, the latest being investigative journalist Ferdinand Mensah Ayité’s bi-weekly, L’Alternative.''

''Togo's supreme court administrative chamber decided on 9 March 2021 to confirm the four-month suspension that the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC) imposed a month ago on the newspaper L’Alternative. The HAAC ordered the suspension in response to a complaint by the minister of urbanism, housing and land reform, who was described as a “forger” by the newspaper because, it said, he used forged documents when administering the property of the family of a wealthy businessman who recently died.'' (8, 9).

*Comments*:
 Both Amnesty International and Reporters without borders report that several journalists have been arrested and charge and media outlets are being censored as a result of them reporting on Covid-19 and how its spreading in Turkey. While these reports are of events occurring in the earlier period, this constitutes a de facto limitation in the latter periods as well, since it sends a clear message what happens if media outlets and journalists report news on Covid-19 that the government does not wish them to report.
In addition, Turkey's government passed a new law censoring social media and digital networks in July, which came into effect in October 1. The law considerably strengthens authorities' control over social networks and threatens the presence of Twitter and Facebook in the country if they do not obey requests to remove contentious content. The legislation means social networks with more than a million unique connections per day must have a representative in Turkey, and platforms will also have to obey Turkish court orders to remove content that's reported as offensive by either individuals or the government within 48 hours. Failure to do so could lead to fines of up to €4.3 million or restrictions on bandwidth, blocking access to the platform.

 Coded as 1 due to wide censorship of domestic media outlets. According to Reporters without Borders, "Ranked last in RSF's 2019 World Press Freedom Index, Turkmenistan is one of the world's most closed countries. The government controls all domestic media and continues to step up its persecution of those who clandestinely report for exile media outlets. The few Internet users can only access a highly-censored version of the Internet, usually in cafes where they must first present identification." (1)

According to Human Rights Watch, "The Turkmen government routinely retaliates against independent reporting inside the country." (2)

 Throughout 2020 and 2021, there are numerous reports of security officials using Covid-19 protocols to block access, intimidate, and harass journalists reporting on government responses. At least a dozen journalists were arrested in Q2 2020 alone, under the auspices of the Covid-19 restrictions. In April 2020, the police arrested a journalist from Freedom Radio and questioned him about his reporting on the government's response [2].

 The parliament passed ammendments to the Criminal Code (Article 244) on 23 March 2020 making spreading false information about infections punishable with a fine or imprisonment, which puts limits on media reporting. Under this new legislation, several journalists have been detained and their equipment was confiscated since 25 July 2020 in connection to a Covid-19 report. The report concerned an alledged dealth of a public official from Covid-19 that was shared by several news outlets, but later on turned out to be false.

 According to the Human Rights Watch: "Authorities have harassed, detained, and prosecuted political opponents, including several legislators, journalists who publish critical information, health workers who criticize the government’s handling of the pandemic (...). Security forces have also confiscated cellphones and laptops from journalists and forced them to erase photos or videos" [3]. A OHCHR report states that they "documented eight cases of security forces, local authorities, and armed colectivos intimidating or impeding journalists from covering the health crisis, as well as six journalists and media workers arrested while reporting on COVID-19 cases" [6]. Additionally, press freedom in Venezuela was already limited before the covid-19 pandemic.

 Vietnam's media is heavily censored and follows the communist party's orders. The sources of independently reported information are bloggers and independent journalists who are subjected to harsh forms of punishment. This would make it challenging for journalists to be critical of the government's response to the pandemic.

A new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.  At least two Facebook users have been given criminal sentences for sharing information deemed to be fake about the virus. The criminal sentences have been up to nine months detention and fines over USD$1000. These restrictions may also contribute to a climate of fear and self-censorship in reporting. As the general media climate in Vietnam has not improved in Q1 and Q2 of 2021, I have continued to code this variable as 1 across all time periods.

 The Zambian government has revoked a licence for one of the country's most popular TV stations after they refused to air government coronavirus-awareness adverts for free. However, this is not a limitation on how the media can report on the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, so it does not affect the score on this variable.

 Press freedom in Zimbabwe is highly restricted due to government harassment and intimidation of reporters. Human Rights Watch named Zimbabwe one of 83 countries that have used the Covid-19 pandemic to crack down on journalists [1]. Other observers also note the limitations on media freedoms in the case [2,3]. 

Several journalists have had their phones confiscated, forced to delete photo, and arrested for e.g. breaking lockdown or having an expired press card, while they were covering enforcements of lockdown, filming police roadblocks, or interviewing people allegedly tortured for attending a protest against the government's covid-19 strategy.

A journalist, Hopewell Chin’ono, who reported about high-level corruption, including in the procurement of COVID-19 medical supplie, was arrested. After 44 days in pre-trial detention, he was released. On November 03, he was rearrested.

The media continue to face restrictions when it comes to reporting on the government response to the pandemic. On 24 February 2021, police barred two journalists from covering the vaccination programme at the Mushagashe Training Centre. 

I did not find more cases on this in Q2 of 2021. However as the media situation has not improved in Zimbabwe, I have continued to code this variable as 1.
