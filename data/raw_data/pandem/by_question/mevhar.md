*Comments*:
 Afghanistan's biggest news agency, Pajhwok Afghan News, has been harrassed since it reported on 32 ventilators that were meant for Afghan Covid-19 patients that were stolen and sold to Pakistan. The director of the agency was interrogated by representatives from the health ministry the day after the report was released.

I have not found more cases of journalists being verbally harassed due to their reporting on Covid-19. However, harassment of journalists does happen frequently in the country.

 Q4 2020:  "On 11 and 12 December 2020, police assaulted and detained Ora News RTV journalist Xhoi Malësia and Kohan Jone newspaper’s editor in chief Qamil Xhani, while they were covering protests in Tirana against police violence. Street clashes erupted in the capital following the death of a 25-year-old man shot by police while enforcing a COVID-linked curfew on 8 December." (Council of Europe, 1)  According  Malësia, the police officer "used a slur to insult his family", which is considered verbal assault and hence mevhar is coded as 1. Since it is a single incident and I found no further evidence of verbal harassment of journalists, mevhar is coded as 0 in Q2 2020, Q3 2020, Q1 2021, and Q2 2021.

 While journalists are facing grave verbal and physical harassment, these cases have not been in relation to Covid-19 or legitimized by them. Rather, such measures have been in relation to the Penal Code, which has been exacerbated after the Coup in 2021. Since this is not specifically on reporting on Covid-19, this is therefore coded as 0.

''In August 2020 police briefly detained a journalist from the Association of Journalists for Human Rights radio station while she was investigating irregularities in the issuing of the national identification card. Also in August Henri Grothe, a blogger who resided in France and regularly criticized CAR authorities on social media, was briefly arrested and his passport confiscated upon his arrival at Bangui M’poko international airport. Grothe was released without any charge.'' (1)

 On 26 March 2020, journalist for state broadcaster Télé Tchad Aly Mahamat Bello, his cameraman Abakar Mahamad Seid and their driver were assaulted and then detained by the Chad Police Mobile Intervention Unit (GMIP) in the capital, N’Djamena, while reporting on government Covid-19 enforcement measures (coronavirus-related restrictions on public gatherings). The Union of Chadian Journalists said the three were interrogated for three hours before being released.'' (1, 2). 

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021 ''Chadian authorities have stepped up restrictions on civic space in recent months with long internet shutdowns, arbitrary arrests, and violations of freedoms of protest and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said ahead of the 11 April 2021 presidential election.''

 1: On 8 May 2020, "Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang." [1]

2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 

I have coded this as verbal harassment as they were asked/forced to leave the country and no physical harm was inflicted upon them.

I have not found new instances of the government and its agents limiting journalists reporting about Covid-19. However the above mentioned journalists continue to be banned from reporting and working in China. The media situation in China has also not improved. Hence, I have continued to code this variable as 1.

 Greek police detained and attacked a Greek journalist, Antonis Rigopoulos, on 17 November 2020 while he was covering a rally in commemoration of the 1973 Polytechnic University student uprising against the military dictatorship. 

''As the journalist was documenting the arrest of protesters, he was approached by traffic police officers, and despite the fact that he was wearing a full gas mask, police tried to fine him €300 under Covid-19 regulations for not wearing a surgical mask. The officers then brought him to the headquarters of the Traffic Police where Rigopoulos claims they addressed him in a threatening and abusive manner in an attempt to provoke him. He later reported that one officer pushed him forcefully into a chair and shouted aggressively in his face. Rigopoulos added that officers repeatedly refused to acknowledge his journalistic ID and took his national ID off him for about half an hour.'' (1-4). 

Since December 2020 up to May 2021, there have been many incidents of police violence against journalists covering protests, but these were unrelated to Covid-19 coverage. (7)

 The Guatemala Journalists Association released a report on Freedom of Expression in Guatemala during the first four months of 2020, in which it reports cases of verbal and physical harassment of journalists (pages 13-15) [1]. Additionally, the Human Rights Ombudsman reports on their website several complaints from journalists of verbal and physical harassment [3, 4]. Instances of harassment of journalists reporting about covid-19 were not identified between October-December, but there is no evidence that they ceased to occur. According to HRW: "Human Rights Watch and CPJ have documented multiple cases since the pandemic began in which President Giammatteiand other authorities or members of the security forces threatened or harassed journalists".

 There are several cases of verbal harassment of journalist in Hong Kong, but no such cases have been found in relation to them reporting on Covid-19. Rather, such harassment seem to be related to quelling the pro-democracy movement, and harassment has been made with reference to the National Security Law that is not linked to Covid-19 measures. This is therefore coded 0.

 A cartoonist working for a newspaper was verbally attacked and threatened by the authorities and pro-government media. A journalist was verbally attacked and threaten by a TV channel close to the government, after she critisized the emergency measures. According to IPI, " journalists reporting on the reality of the situation inside hospitals are regularly denounced as “scaremongers” by the public service broadcaster."

 There are several cases where journalists have been threatened and verbally harassed when trying to report on Covid-19 in Iraq. In Q2 of 2020, several journalists were detained and arrested for trying to cover authorities handling of Covid-19. In November 2020, journalists (and bloggers) have been targeted with defamation complaints by the government for investigating and reporting on Covid-19 cases and deaths (note also that there is several cases of harassment for reporting on other issues, primarily government protests). In February 2021, three reporters were sentenced to several years in prison for having reported on protests against the governments handling of Covid-19 and its economic consequences. The Iraqi authorities, and especially it seems, the Kurdish region, have continuously verbally harassed journalists through various threats of arrests and sentences (as well as carrying out many of these). This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

 'Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya, ARTICLE 19 identified that there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1)

''Although journalists were listed as essential service workers and exempted from curfew restrictions, reports indicate that on-duty journalists were harassed. At least 10 journalists and digital content creators have been arrested or threatened with prosecution under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act 2018. They were accused of publishing and spreading false and alarming information on social media about the new coronavirus. At least 10 others were arrested under the Public Order Act, for allegedly flouting the curfew.'' (2) 

''On 4 April 2021, police beat and arrested David Omurunga, a journalist with Milele FM radio at around 8.10pm, while he was walking home from work. Despite him presenting his identification card including official press card, the officers assaulted him and bundled into a waiting police van for violating 8pm to 4am curfew protocols. Journalists are listed as essential service providers and therefore are allowed under ordinary circumstances to operate outside curfew time. According to David Omurunga, the police confiscated his video and voice recorder and both his national identification and press card. He filed a complaint report with the police at Nakuru police station, Omurunga told ARTICLE 19 Eastern Africa that he was yet to receive any report of his case even after making several follow ups at the station. He also yet to receive back his press card and his equipment.'' (10) 

There are many more attacks on journalists but unrelated to the pandemic.

Another journalist felt threatened after being pressured to reveal his sources on a story on the upcoming lockdown. However, no reports of any threats or other verbal harassment toward journalists has been found in the later periods, and this is therefore only coded 1 in the first period.

In January 2021, a woman was attacked by protesters that alleged that she was an infiltrated police officer.

 López Obrador often criticizes the press and their coverage of Covid-19. A man, allegedly from an organized crime group, threatened to blow up a newsroom if the newspaper did not stop criticizing the president's response to Covid-19. Lópes Obrador said his government had nothing to do with the threats (https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21832-mexican-newspaper-reforma-threatened-coverage-president-and-his-management-Covid-19). In January, a politician threatened a journalist for reporting on Covid-19.

 I did not find any information related to this. However there is complete control over communication within North Korea. Citizens can also be sent to concentration camps for looking at online media. The Korean Central News Agency is the only permitted source of news within the country. These factors may deter journalists from being critical in their reporting. Furthermore, the restricted nature of news may mean that harrassment could be happening without credible reports of such occurances.

This is deemed a verbal harassment of these journalists, and thus coded as 1. However, no evidence of any threats to journalists has been found in relation to Covid-19 (or anything else) since then, and this seems to be an isolated incident. This is therefore coded 0 for all other periods.

 The Prime Minister published a denigrating statement towards journalists in general and the country's two main TV channels on 11 May 2020, as well as accusations of lying and threats over the funding of the country's public TV channel on Twitter on 21-22 March 2020. Blaž Zgaga, a journalist for RSF, was insulted and verbally threatened by the authorities after asking about a new Covid-19 crisis unit (1, 2, 3). On 2 August 2020, the Acting Director of the Government Communication Office (UKOM) " tweeted urging citizens to report and denounce any media or journalists in Slovenia who “obviously and shamelessly use manipulations” in their work to purposefully mislead people" (4). On 15 October 2020,  Prime Minister Janez Janša verbally attacked the Slovenian Press Agency on Twitter (5). He also accused the media for the spread of Covid-19 (7).
In 2021 the attackes persisted, such as in April 2021, when the prime minister accused 24ur of lying about the Covid-19 pandemic (6). Mevhar is therefore coded as 1 in all periods.

 The state is investigating and jailing journalists, accusing them of offending the honor or prestige of the head of state, or spreading fake news. Also, and more clearly verbal harassment, an official from the presidential palace reached a journalist via Twitter asking him where he got his sources.  I found no evidence that the violations stopped, so mevhar is coded as 1 in all time periods.

*Comments*:
 Throughout 2020 and 2021, security forces harassed and assaulted journalists while enforcing Covid-19 protocols [1,2,3,4], despite the press being exempt from many of these measures as essential workers [5]. At least 12 cases of assault was reported between just March 19 (beginning of lockdown) and April 24, 2020. Journalists have been beaten, slapped, punched, kicked, and had their camera taken and forced to delete pictures, when reporting on police enforcing lockdown measures [5,6,7,8]. Harassment of journalists before and after national elections in January 2021 supposedly for pandemic response has been widespread [9]. There is no sign of improvement.

*Comments*:
 Neither Reporters Without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any verbal harassment of journalists in UK, and no other indications have been found of there having been any such harassment during Q2-Q3 of 2020 
However, on November 5 2020, ''Journalists and photographers covering an anti-lockdown protest in London were ordered to leave and threatened with arrest by police. Photographers covering the event had reported that police were “hostile and very aggressive” towards members of the press throughout the evening'' (2). A similar situation occurred on March 23 2021 in Bristol, where a police officer threatened two members of the press who covered a protest in Bristol. This protest was however not related to Covid-19, and is thus not accounted for here. As the event on November 5 seems like an isolated incident, this is coded 0 for the rest of the periods.

*Comments*:
 There are numerous instances in which President Trump and his colleagues have verbally harassed journalists and news agencies. Reporters without borders have published two articles on this, and the verbal harassment of individual journalists and news agencies are widely covered in the press in general, especially those stemming from President Trump. However, reports of this have only been found in the first period, and this is therefore only coded 1 for this period. Note also that some journalists have been subject to verbal and physical harassment when covering Black Lives Matter-protests and election protests, but these are not regarded here as they are not directly linked to Covid-19. The same has been reported in some instances in later periods, where members of the press have been threatened by law enforcement. However, these have not had any connection to Covid-19 restrictions either, and thus not accounted for here. As no evidence has been found of any threats in relation to Covid-19, this is coded 0 for all other periods.

 There are reports of harassment and imprisonment of journalists. "From March 16 onwards, Espacio Público counted at least 105 cases and 250 of the 965 violations directly linked to the pandemic, from arbitrary arrests for publications on social networks referring to possible cases of coronavirus, to blocking of web pages that reported on the course of the disease. 41% of the violations related to Covid-19 were intimidation, 22% were censorship cases, 12% were threats, 11% judicial harassment, 7% administrative restrictions, 4% verbal harassment and 3% aggression."

 I did not find any information related to this across all time periods. However, there are multiple reports of journalists being harrassed for non-Covid-19 related reasons. Journalits are often harrassed and jailed after bring critical of the government.

 Many journalists report being harassed and threatened with violence when covering covid-19 related issues.
This has continued to be the case in Q1 and Q2 of 2021 and no information was found indicating that the violations stopped.
