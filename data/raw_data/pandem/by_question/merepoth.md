 Q2 2020: On 14 May 2020 A heavy fine and a shutdown threat was imposed on a TV channel RTV Ora News for violating social distances rules, which is argued to be related to the chanel's critisim of the government. Since it was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021.

 RSF (1): ''Taking advantage of the coronavirus crisis and the resulting halt to the protests, the authorities adopted draconian and vaguely-worded laws in order to clamp down even more on press freedom. Journalists have been prosecuted and convicted for news coverage that is alleged to have “endangered national unity” or “threatened public order and state security”. Several online media have been blocked and are no longer accessible. The harassment is making it very difficult for journalists and media outlets to operate. The authorities are clearly cracking down harder on all forms of dissent as citizens continue to demand more freedoms.'' 

'The newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune of Algeria approved a bill in April 2020 amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.'' (see 3, 4, 5; government Decree: 6). 

Further, the Algerian government adopted in December 2020 its first ever decree governing electronic media. The decree presents new restrictions for operating digital media in Algeria (2, 7). ''Among the changes brought by this decree, Algerian media outlets are for example required to register on a .dz internet domain, in a clear attempt to control their content given strict censorship laws in Algeria. Indeed, most, if not all, opposition sites are registered outside of Algeria to preserve the safety of their contributors, who often use nicknames to protect themselves and their families from state harassment.'' (2). This Decree is not directly related to the pandemic, however it affects the general media environment and journalists' reporting. 

''At the end of March 2020, the daily El-Sawt-el-Akher published a letter from a member of parliament to the wali of Batna in which he denounced a misdiagnosis by the Algiers Pasteur Institute. According to the deputy, a patient who tested negative for Covid-19 was in fact a carrier of the virus, a situation that would have caused the disease to spread in his locality. After being summoned by the national police, two journalists and the director of this publication were placed under judicial supervision for "undermining national unity" and "distribution of a publication that could harm the national interest" ...'' (8).

 Journalist Natig Isbatov was arrested on 9 April 2020 and "jailed for allegedly violating lockdown regulations by filming a protest outside an employment office in Baku." (1) Since 21 June 2020, new quarantine measures restricted journalists' freedom of movement since they had to obtain permissions to leave home, which likely placed restrictions on all reporting. Merepoth is therefore coded as 1 for March-June 2020, July-September 2020. 

Restrictions on journalists were removed in September (see meinf). Since the arrest of Natig Isbatov was a single incident and no further cases were reported, merepoth is coded as 0 in October-December 2020, January-March 2021, April-June 2021.

However, the Digital Security Act which was introduced in 2018 has been increasingly used since March 2020 on journalists who have been reporting on Covid-19 and the government's response to the pandemic.

Reports explain that the law imposes serious restrictions on freedom of expression in Bangladesh.

*Comments*:
 Myanmar had severe restrictions on media freedom before the coup in 2021, and after that more or less complete restrictions on media freedom. While none of these restrictions, as far as have been found, were made in relation or with reference to Covid-19, but rather with Article 505 of the Penal code which was in place before the pandemic. However, journalists were not exempt from the stay at home-orders that have been invoked at different times and in different regions since the start of the pandemic, and international journalists were not exempt from the ban on foreigners entering the country, effectively limiting a lot of coverage on both Covid-19 and non Covid-19-related news. Since the government after the coup have kept most restrictions in place, this is assumed to be ongoing. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

 The government has the ability to limit reporting on non-Covid 19 related news with reference to the pandemic. The new emergency law which was passed also allows the government to ban the publication of “any information that could cause unrest, fear or disorder”. This is not limited to just Covid-19 related issues. However, documentation of such cases happening have not be reported.

1:  In May 2021, the Cambodia government banned the media from reporting on Covid-19 related news from 'red zones'. These red zones are areas with high infection rates. As all reporting in the red zones are prohibited, I have coded this variable as 1 in Q2 of 2021.

 There are many incidents of arrests, harasshment and intimidation of journalists in Cameroon (see 1, 2, 3). 
''The authorities are refusing to provide information about the coronavirus pandemic to several very popular media outlets that are critical of the government.'' 
''Press freedom continues its long decline in Cameroon, now one of Africa’s most dangerous countries for journalists. The government often points to the existence of many media outlets but this doesn’t mean they enjoy a favourable environment. Reporters are often detained arbitrarily and prosecuted, including by military tribunals or special courts.'' (3) 

However, there are no explicit Covid-19 related instances. The only relevant incidents relate to media limitations on access to information.

 The Chinese government has maintained very tight control over the media since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. While there are foreign journalists and news agencies working in China, they encounter multiple obstacles while working in the field. According to Reporters sans Frontières, "more than 115 currently detained, often in conditions that pose a threat to their lives." (1)

Beijing has expelled least 14 international journalists since March 2020. Most recently, two Australian China correspondents working for the Australian ABC network were asked to leave in September 2020. While this may not be directly linked to Covid-19, the reduced presence of international media in China would make it harder to attain information contrary to the narrative propagated by the Chinese government.

I have not found instances of the government placing de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid 19 related news but with reference to the pandemic in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 Congolese reporter Faustin Mbiya, a journalist at Foundation Daniel Madimba radio station based in Mbuji-Mayi, was arrested with charges of violating Covid-19 restrictions on 9 May 2020. He was filming a broadcast - unrelated to the pandemic. He was freed on bail of 300,000 Congolese francs (160 euros) on 12 May 2020 pending trial on charges of “violating emergency health measures” and “insulting the provincial authorities.”'' (1, 2).

 The emergency measures, in particular Décret n°00106/PR/MEFPTFPDS of 10 April 2020 (1), designating the essential services and personnel of the public, parapublic and private on-call sector during the state of emergency linked to Covid-19, does not exempt journalists and the media from the movement restrictions of the emergency measures. 

Journalists and editors in Gabon report that this lack of granted authorizations poses a problem for them reporting in the field (2). Emergency measures and curfew are still in place by June 2021.

In addition, the media in Gabon are facing government censorship (6). The role of HAC (High Authority of Communication) in particular has been extremely problematic the last years (4, 5), suspending several media and newspapers. Although these developments related to facts before Covid-19, it is nevertheless a problem which relates to the current situation.

 No limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news. However, the greek media landscape has worsened significantly in 2020. Greece now ranks 70 compared to 65 a year ago in the RSF index. After New Democracy's party victory in the July 2019 general election, public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA were placed under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis through a presidential decree. Ever since, the Greek government has ''sought, directly or indirectly, to control the flow of information closely as part of its efforts to deal with both the coronavirus pandemic and the refugee crisis.'' (6).  

In addition, when the Greek government allocated €20 million to media outlets for them to carry “Stay at Home” public health messages, it outsourced the distribution of these funds to a private media shop company, bypassing its obligation to make public all transactions conducted by the state. After opposition parties  parliamentary watchdogs protested the lack of transparency, the government in early July, released the list containing the amounts given per media outelt, it was revealed that outlets critical of the government received less than 1 percent of the total sum, compared to pro-government outlets, and one particularly anti-government outlet was excluded entirely from the funding. (1).

Also, ''media in Greece rank among the least trusted by the public, compared to other countries in Europe.... a combination of ownership issues, drastic cuts in costs and jobs, and a peculiar relationship to political power, has produced a deeply problematic media landscape, where unbiased, dispassionate coverage is hard to find....During Covid-19, the partisanship of Greek media played out even more intensely. Stories about government contracts that were handed out in less than clear circumstances were featured only in a handful of independent, alternative outlets. Scrutiny over how the government would meet the challenge of building up a public healthcare system devastated by years of cuts was likewise absent from the majority of the media. Questions over the government’s implementation of safety protocols for travelers from abroad were largely unasked...'' (1).

 No evidence of limitations related to Covid-19 was found. 
The media are criticized by the President Alpha Conde and the authorities periodically try to censor critical media. 
Three websites, Le Lynx, the Guinée Matin newspaper’s website and Aminata.com, were suspended or threatened with suspension during the October 2020 elections (1). 

According to the US Department of State's 2020 report on human rights practices, ''The government penalized media outlets and journalists who broadcasted items criticizing government officials and their actions. Some journalists accused government officials of attempting to influence the tone of their reporting.'' (2) 

However, these violations are unrelated to Covid-19.

 Journalists who criticize the government face the possibility of up to 18 months in prison under a directive that the head of Criminal Investigation Agency issued on 4 April 2020. The directive orders the police to crack down on ‘corona virus related hoaxes’, ‘online frauds regarding the sales of health equipment’ and ‘hostile information about the president and government’.

Daniel Bastard, head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk has said that ‘In this directive, the Indonesia police are taking advantage of the need to combat disinformation linked to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to rein in journalists who might want to publish information critical of President Joko Widodo or his government' (3).

At least 57 people have been prosecuted under this law. As the law is still in place, I have continued to code this variable as 1 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 Through Irans ban on printed media, they have halted the reporting on non-Covid-19 related news as well with reference to Covid-19. While the news outlets are allowed to publish online, it is still a de facto infringement of media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news. A newspaper was also shut down for publishing an interview with an official working in Iran's Covid-19 Taskforce. This is therefore coded as 1.

 There are several types of de facto limitations on media in Iraq, but no reports or sources have been found that state Iraqi government and agencies using Covid-19 as an excuse to limit other types of reporting. Rather, they have existing legislation in place such as Article 433 of Iraq’s Penal Code to prosecute journalists and limit media freedom, and this seems to have been the legal reference and also the broader legitimization when limiting media freedom in Iraq during the pandemic.  This is therefore coded as 0.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news in Italy between Q2-Q4 of 2020 and during Q1 of 2021, and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations.
However, in Q2 of 2021, there has been reported that a journalist was barred from entering a court room and reporting on a trial on sexual violence due to Covid-19 rules. These rules are not supposed to hinder journalists reporting, and it did constitute a limitation in reporting on this case. This is therefore coded 1 for Q2 of 2021. Note however that it is the only case observed in which such limitation to media has occurred.

 Jordan has, by banning printed media, halted the reporting on non-Covid-19 related news as well with reference to Covid-19. While the news outlets are allowed to publish online, it is still a de facto infringement of media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news. Furthermore, the vaguely formulated emergency measure to ban spreading of “rumours, fabrications and false news that sows panic” can easily be used toward non-Covid-19 related news as well. No evidence has been found that either of these have been lifted, and this is coded 1 for all periods.

 There are widespread reports on the Kenyan authorities de-facto attempting to limit reporting about the about the coronavirus. Also, the media environment in Kenya faces many challenged and restrictions for journalists. 

''Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kenya (and up until September 2020), there have been at least 48 attacks against Kenyan journalists and restrictions to their work concerning the pandemic, including physical assault, arrest, telephone or verbal threats, online harassment and lack of access to public information, officials and buildings by security force officials while executing the emergency measures.'' (1, 2) 

''At least 10 journalists and digital content creators have been arrested or threatened with prosecution under the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act 2018. They were accused of publishing and spreading false and alarming information on social media about the new coronavirus. At least 10 others were arrested under the Public Order Act, for allegedly flouting the curfew.'' (1)

''Journalists and media outlets in Kenya faced increased pressure after Uhuru Kenyatta assumed office in 2013. The current administration has continued to enact laws that undermine media freedom. Some of these laws are the Media Act, 2013, Kenya Information, Communication (Amendment) Act, 2013 and Security Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014. These laws imposed tough penalties on journalists and expanded offences for which they could be punished. The government's increased intolerance of the media culminated in the temporary shutdown of four independent TV stations after they covered former opposition chief Raila Odinga's symbolic presidential inauguration in 2017''.

According to IPI: "Authorities in Kyrgyzstan have excluded 20 different independent media outlets from receiving special press passes which allow them exemption from lockdown rules, giving them instead only to state-run media."

 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news in Laos, by making it punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes. No evidence has been found that this regulation having been repealed or amended. This is therefore coded 1 for all periods.

 Neither Reporters without Borders nor International Press Institute have reported any de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 in Lebanon, and no other indications have been found of there having been implemented any such limitations. However, the state of emergency imposed after the Beirut explosion in August 2020 introduced far reaching powers for the government that could possibly limit media, and Lebanese media do face other restrictions, for example through defamation laws (an introduction of these can be found in this HRW report: https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/11/15/there-price-pay/criminalization-peaceful-speech-lebanon) This is coded 0, as no evidence has been found that existing or new measures having limited reporting on non Covid-19-related news with reference to Covid-19, but it should be noted that the media seem to face limitations in other aspects.

 "[On] April 29, Deputy Information Minister Eugene Fahngon told reporters that existing press passes, which journalists use to move freely amid the lockdown, would be voided and new ones issued [...]". (1) This led to several journalist getting stopped by security officers. Authorities also limited the access to the president's office. 
There is much less reporting on the media situation in Liberia after Q2 of 2020, and the de jure limitation in place on media under the state of emergency seem to have ended when the state of emergency ended on 2020-07-21. The US state department in their human rights report also report that media in Liberia is relatively free, although issues such as self-censorship and government-owned media outlets exist. From the evidence found on this after the end of the limitation to media freedom under the state of emergency, there is not any limitations in place that indicates this should be coded as 1. This is therefore coded as 0 from Q4 and onwards, as no evidence of any limitations to non-Covid-19 related reporting has been found after the end of the state of emergency.

 Yes, mainly due to the de-jure limitations, according to which the press is automatically requisitioned by the govenrment in cases of emergency (see melim variable). The state of emergency ended on 18 October 2020, but was reintroduced in 3 April 2021 and is in place at least until 28 June 2021. 

Under the state of health emergency, the Ministry of Communication and Culture is given extraordinary poewrs to control information regarding the pandemic. (2) 

On 22 April 2021, Malagasy authorities issued an interministerial decision that suspended the broadcasting of nine radio and audiovisual programs. The programs were suspended under the state of emergency, on the grounds that they were ''likely to disturb public order and security and harm national unity " (3, 4).

 The Malaysian authorities have arrested journalists under Section 505 of the penal code (as well as other legislation), which bans statements causing "fear or alarm to the public". While this vague formulation could be used to prosecute journalists on non-Covid-19 related news as well, there is no reports found of that happening, and the authorities seem to only use this legislation to place de facto limitations on reporting on Covid-19 related issues as of yet. This is therefore coded as 0.

On 12 March 2021, issued an "anti-fake news" emergency ordinance. With this instrument, the government is able to effectively ban any information  that is not its liking. The wording of the ordinance is not specific to the pandemic. The authorities would be able to use this to place de-facto limitations on reporting about non-Covid 19 related news. Hence I have coded this variable as 1 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 [1,2,3].

(1) 

''Malian journalists are protesting orders by the transitional administration that they see as suppressing freedom of the press in the West African country.In a protest meeting of media workers on 20 December 2020, the Union of Free Radio and Television (URTEL) rejected these measures, stressing that "in the name of the fight against the coronavirus disease, we will never accept from anyone the questioning of essential freedoms, including freedom of the press".'' (2). 
''In a statement, the Malian Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, explained that "contrary to some interpretations in the media, the instruction of 18 December 2020 is only an update of an instruction dating from 2015 declaring a state of emergency on the national territory".'' (2, 3). 

The state of emergency is still in place until 26 June 2021.

 On 24 June 2020, the National Assembly approved a new law - the Law on Combatting Manipulation of Information - aimed at prohibiting allegedly false news posts on social media. The Law states as its objective to prevent manipulation of information, publication of false news, and the creation of fake digital identities “especially during periods of elections and during health crises”, like the Covid-19 pandemic. Penalties for violations range from three months to five years in prison, and fines from 50,000 to 200,000 Ouguiya (US$1,325-5,300) (2, 3; see also 4 - 6). 
Many opposition parliamentarians as well as human rights activists denounced the law, declaring that it risks undermining the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution (3).

 With the Emergency Laws, there are limitations in media reporting during the pandemic. Also, Morocco's media face judicial harassment, and many journalists and citizen-journalists continue to be imprisoned, in light of Covid-19.

With the Decree No. 2-20-292 of 23 March 2020 (1, 2) on special provisions for a State of Health Emergency, the government is enabled to ... take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).'' (3)

Also, in a statement on 22 March 2020, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news (see 5 in arabic). The Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous, permitted newspapers and magazines to resume the issuance, publication, and distribution of paper editions starting on 26 May 2020 (6). 

Further, ''Journalist Nazha ElKhalidi and her fiancée have been put under house arrest since 21 November 2020. The journalist was detained by Moroccan security services due to her coverage of human rights violations by Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara. She has recently noted and reported the crackdown on freedom of expression by the Morrocan authorities in Western Sahara. Morrocan authorities claimed that this measure is part of its Covid-19 precautionary procedures. Nazha and her fiancée confirmed that social distancing and other precautionary measures were taken into account when organizing the ceremony.'' (8)

 A reporter was arrested and accused of publishing "false and damaging" information, which violated the Covid-19 law. Ebonyi state governor said that the reporter lied in a recent report he wrote on Lassa fever outbreak in the state.

As part of public health restrictions on assembly, 92 journalists had their access to the presidential villa suspended. Effectively stopping them from covering government press briefings. Since I did not find evidence of the violations discontinuing, merepoth is coded as 1 in all time periods.

There are reports that journalist were excluded from a hearing of the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes, however, this restriction was not with reference to the pandemic.

Note that there has been debate regarding Norway during Q1 and Q2 of 2021 not exempting journalists from the mandatory quarantine of 10 days when entering the country, which in practice limits international journalists covering news in Norway. However, as this does not influence the reporting on media and journalists based in Norway, this is not accounted for.

 Philippines’ biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air on 5 May 2020. The network had expected to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown. However the National Telecommunications Commission decided against renewing its 25 year franchise. Duterte has repeatedly threatened to stop ABS-CBN, and previously accused it of failing to broadcast his campaign advertisements. In a speech in December, he taunted the network, stating: “ABS-CBN, your contract is about to expire. If I were you, you’re better off selling it … I will make sure that you will remember this episode of our times for ever.”

The ABS-CSN network continues to be closed in 2021.

 Q2 2020: Wojciech Jakub Atys, a photographer for Gazeta Wyborcza, was asked to appear in court after taking pictures (alledgedly because of breaking social distancing rules) of a protest outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s home on 29 March 2020 that opposed changes to the electoral law. Another reporter for OKO.press website potentially faces a 13,000 fine for planning to cover a protest on 10 April 2020 outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s and "failure to respect social distancing and organising a public gathering." (the protest was planned but did not take place).  

Q3 2020: Two independent journalists were refused accreditation to the President's trip to Italy "due to a lack of space caused by COVID-19 restrictions, in apparent retaliation for critical coverage. Media accused the office of the president of using the Covid-19 rules to side-line critical media." (1, IPI)

Q4 2020: On 17 November 2020, Angelika Pitoń was covering protests and was charged with using "indecent" words towards the police and was not wearing a mask, as per Covid-19 regulations. "Pitoń said that the officers in Zakopane intervened because of an alleged violation of social distancing rules, yet her charges presented refer to not wearing a mask." (2, Council of Europe)

Q1 2021, Q2 2021: coded as 1 because there were several violations in the previous time periods and I found no indication that the situation improved.

*Comments*:
 The curfew in Senegal was implemented by quota, i.e the schedule would vary over time (see 2, 3), and the government did not manage to issue authorization for exemption from the restrictions to all journalsists and media, preventing them therefore from accessing information and reporting in the field.
The state of emergency and the related curfew -which affected media - were lifted in Senegal on 30 June 2020.

''The Ministry of the Interior was unable to issue exemptions to all the media and all the journalists who requested this document which allows them to circulate during the curfew "the distribution was made by quota" comments Bamba Kassé, the general secretary of the Senegalese journalists' union.'' (1) 

Further, ''After several years of discussion, a new press code was adopted 2017 but the required implementation decrees have yet to be signed. Two bills were nonetheless submitted to the cabinet in early 2021. The new code disappointed journalists because it failed to decriminalise press offences and because it provides for the confiscation of equipment and material and even the closure of media outlets for threats to state security. Press freedom violations, some of them by the security forces, were registered in 2020. Certain stories with a religious link can still be taboo. The headquarters of the newspaper Les Echos were ransacked after it reported that a Muslim religious leader had caught Covid-19.'' (5) 

''Journalists in Senegal say they have rarely experienced as much intimidation as they have since opposition leader Ousmane Sonko was detained for several days earlier this month, sparking unrest that claimed five lives.
Media rights groups have accused the government of clamping down on the press to quash the protests.'' (4) 

Also, in March 2021, during  the protests that emerged when opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, a leading rival to President Macky Sall, was arrested and accused of rape, Senegal experienced an internet and social media shutdown: 
"Network data from the NetBlocks Internet Observatory confirm the disruption of social media and messaging apps in Senegal as of 5 March 2021. Metrics show that Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and some Telegram servers were restricted on leading cellular network operator Orange/Sonatel as of early morning Friday. Affected services have subsequently been restored from 7:30 a.m. UTC," reads a statement by NetBlocks.'' (6)

 On 10 August 2020, the Tanzanian government announced that broadcasting foreign content would be banned without government permission. This includes content about Covid-19.

 1: On May 22 2020, Bangkok police arrested prominent pro-democracy activists Anurak Jeantawanich and Tosaporn Serirak for violating the ban on public assembly – one of the emergency measures imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The arrest was triggered by a remembrance service they held earlier that day with supporters of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship – known as the “Red Shirts” – to mark the 6th anniversary of the 2014 military coup. (5)

2: Thai authorities previously arrested Anurak on the same charges on May 13 2020, when he held a remembrance service to demand justice for those killed and wounded by the military during the crackdown on the 2010 Red Shirts protests. Even though thermal scanners to detect fevers were provided at the events and participants wore face masks, the activists were accused of ignoring social distancing, acting in a way likely to spread the virus, and disobeying lawful orders in both cases. If found guilty, they face two years in prison and a 40,000 baht (US$1,250) fine (5). 

3: In southern Thailand, local authorities in Songkhla province denied a request by villagers in Singha Nakhon district to hold a rally on May 24 2020 in protest of the government’s plan to build beach walls and breakwaters on Muang Ngam Beach. Despite an assurance from the organizers to follow social distancing and other Covid-19 measures to keep people safe, officials prohibited the rally.

As these incidents do not include professional journalists, this variable has been coded as 0.

4: The emergency decree allows the Thai government to impose censorship over the various media outlets. This occured in October 2020 when Voice TV was shut down after the TV station covered a democracy protest in Bangkok on 16 October 2020. This protest had nothing to do with Covid-19. However the government claimed that the coverage of the protest had violated media restrictions under the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situations Act. As the ban is still in place, I have continued to code this variable as 1 in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

 There are reports of attempts at censoring journalists who investigate corruption cases, but explicit evidence of limitations on reporting on Covid-19 could not be found (1, 2, 3). 

According to RSF, ''The development of an investigative journalism culture is being held back by the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication, a media regulator whose lack of independence is clear from the way it harasses, prosecutes and imposes sanctions that have included suspending one newspaper after another, the latest being investigative journalist Ferdinand Mensah Ayité’s bi-weekly, L’Alternative.''

''Togo's supreme court administrative chamber decided on 9 March 2021 to confirm the four-month suspension that the High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication (HAAC) imposed a month ago on the newspaper L’Alternative. The HAAC ordered the suspension in response to a complaint by the minister of urbanism, housing and land reform, who was described as a “forger” by the newspaper because, it said, he used forged documents when administering the property of the family of a wealthy businessman who recently died.'' (8, 9).

*Comments*:
 While there are de facto limitations as a consequence of or in relation to the pandemic, and many reports on journalists being charged with criminal offences for investigative reporting, no case has been found where the Turkish government or its agents have justified such acts of charging journalists for reporting on non-Covid-19 related news with any reference to the pandemic during Q2 and Q3 of 2020. However, in Q4 of 2020, there are reports that journalists were banned by a court from reporting of a case of illegal construction on a historic site, claiming Covid-19 being the reason. The paper that initially reported on this ban was also subject to a 3-day ban on operating. Therefore, this is coded 1 for Q4 of 2020. After this, however, no such limitations referencing Covid-19 has been found, and this is coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021.

Security forces have harassed, intimidated, and arrested journalists, despite their movement being exempted from Covid-19 restrictions [5].

 The government is using the state of emergency to silence journalists who criticize the government. Dozens of journalists have been arbitrarily detained and prosecuted since President Nicolás Maduro declared a covid-19 state of emergency. According to the Human Rights Watch: "Authorities have harassed, detained, and prosecuted political opponents, including several legislators, journalists who publish critical information, health workers who criticize the government’s handling of the pandemic (...). Security forces have also confiscated cellphones and laptops from journalists and forced them to erase photos or videos" [1].  Additionally, even though the law allows for members of the press to continue working during the lockdown measures, there are reports that the government restricted their freedom of moment, which limited the reporting about non-covid-19 related news.

Their trial was ultimately dismissed in September 2020.
