 All executive decrees with Covid-19 measures had a limit date upon their issuance. The curfew e.g. was initially issued for a duration of 2 weeks (see 1,2) or 1 month (see 4, 5). See a list of Covid-19 decrees: 6. 

Nevertheless, the legal instruments used did not have a limit date, i.e. there has not been an activation of the legal instrument, nor has the government stated for how long it intends to legislate with decree powers and the Law n° 88-07 of 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail. 

The latest update on the measures includes an extension of the nightly 23:59-04:00 curfew through at least 20 June 2021 across 19 provinces, including Algiers, Oran, Tebessa, and Constantine.The government has eased some other domestic measures (7).

 The Law nº 17/91, Article 8, establishes that a state of emergency can't last more than 90 days and, when declared, it must have an end date, but it can be renewed with legislative approval. It was first declared for 15 days, and later extended. The state of calamity was first declared until June 9 2020, and later extended. The government renews the public calamity period every 30 days. It has been announcing monthly the extensions, alongside new decrees.

 March-June 2020: Decisions by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 19 and 21 March (prohibition of gathering in public places) have a 30-day time limit. However, the decision by the Civil Protection Headquarters from 23 March (which prohibits individuals from leaving their place of residence without a special permit, to be issued for very limited cases, "Odluka o zabrani napuštanja mjesta prebivališta i stalnog boravka u Republici Hrvatskoj") does not mention a time limit. I also did not find a time limit mentioned in press conferences or local media outlets. Moreover, an amendment to 23 March decision from 18 April explicitly mentions that "the necessary measure prohibiting leaving the place of residence and permanent residence in the Republic of Croatia shall be applied as long as there is a serious risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease, ie until this Decision is repealed. " (1) Although the decision was lifted on 11 May 2020, emlimit is coded as 0 since there was no time limit at the time the decision was passed and there is no explicit time limit in the legal instrument (the Civil Protection Act). 
July-September, October-December, January-June 2021: all measures taken under the Civil Protection act have a time limit.

*Comments*:
 The first major measures taken were to limit social gatherings to 10 people as well as closing night clubs, bars etc. on the 18 of March 2020, and these were initially set to the 30 of March 2020. There have been different time limits for different measures during the coded period. However, the legal instrument these measures were taken under had a sunset clause set to 2021-03-01, and was then terminated. It was replaced with a permanent law which includes many of the powers of the initial amendment, but also much more oversight, judicial review etc. From 2021-03-01, there is thus no time limit on the legal instrument used to implement measures related to Covid-19, but as far as have been seen, there are time limits on all measures taken under this new law (in general, each measure can not be in place more than 4 weeks at a time, although some longer time periods can be used in exceptions - the amount of time a disease can be regarded as dangerous to society as a whole also has a time limit of 6 months at a time). This is therefore coded as 1 for Q2 in 2021 as well, as there seem to be no measures under it that can or is be implemented indefinetly although the law as an instrument is permanent.

 Under Art 154 of Egypt's 2014 constitution, the president with parliamentary approval can declare a state of emergency for up to three months, with three-month extensions if approved by two-thirds of parliament. In this sense, there is an officially declared time limit. However, the current 596-member parliament is tightly controlled by intelligence agencies and dominated by the al-Sisi's supporters. It has acted largely as a rubber stamp for his policies with almost no opposition.

After the latest extension, the State of Emergency is to remain till 28 January 2021. **Update the date here**

 The initial declaration of State of Emergency under the Emergency Powers Act limited it to April 14 2020, and was subsequently extended with defined time limits until it expired on June 16. The Communicable Disease Act was in place before the pandemic, and has no end date itself. Note however that the provisions taken under it have, as far as have been seen, always had time limits and continues to do so. This is therefore coded as 1 for all periods.

 France lifted the (first) state of emergency on 10 July 2020. The emergency law, initially declared until 24 May 2020, had been prolonged for 2 extra months, until 24 July 2020.
The law lifting the state of emegrency and organizing the transition period was valid between 11 July 2020 and 30 October 2020.  

Due to a second wave of Covid-19, the state of health emergency was re-instituted on 14 October 2020 initially by decree (6), and later on, on 5 November 2020, the Assemblée Nationale voted in favour of extending the state of emergency until 16 February 2021. 
 
The state of health emergency had been extended several times during 2021 and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly, gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (6)

*Comments*:
 State of emergency was initially declared for 15 days. On 11 May 2020 the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. After the new law, all measures and the state of emergency had a 45-day limit, and were being renewed. 

The Senate granted a 45-days extension of the state of emergency on 3 October 2020 to the authorities, i.e. up to mid November 2020, which was validated by the National Assembly and the Senate a day later. However, the Gabonese government, although these measures ended on 15 November 2020, had not proceeded to a renewal, hence the measures were in place but lacked legal basis. 

The government has been continuously prolonging for 45 days each time the state of health emergency up until June 2021. The latest extension runs through 28 June 2021.

Since the legal instrument that the measures are based on has a time limit until 1 January 2021  (Article 45 (3)  on "Temporary measures to be taken until January 1, 2021" of the Law of Georgia on Public Health), emlimit is coded as 1.

 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. The time limit for the restrictions taken under this amendment depends on how quickly the extent of infections drop in each state (and some will not have them imposed if infection rates are low), but the time limit for the amendment being in effect is 2021-06-30. Since there is a general time limit on the measures, this is coded as 1.

*Comments*:
 Since March 2020, President Akufo-Addo has issued a series of Executive Instruments, many of which are unavailable in their full-text online (speeches can be found here [1]). Each announcement came with various extensions - usually for one to two weeks - of the previously adopted restrictions. However, speeches often portrayed these as "until further notice", reflecting the President's unchecked power of extension through the IRA.

Since 31 January 2021, new restrictions have been in force without a specific end date [3]. During his last published speech on 28 February 2021, President Akufo-Addo decreed "until further notice, all the restrictions as announced in my last address remain in force, and the Police will continue to ensure compliance by all and sundry. [4]" On 16 May 2021 the president said the restrictions would remain in force "until herd immunity is achieved" [5]. 

This contradicts the Imposition of Restrictions Act, which allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4) [6].

 The legal instrument used to deal with the pandemic- art. 44(1) of the Constitution - does not require an official invocation, and there are no provisions in the Constitution for how long it should be used. The government has not clarified for how long it intends to legislate using art 44(1). 

Nevertheless, each of the provisions taken to combat Covid-19 had an end date (see a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 1). 
The strictest measure, i.e. the nationwide lockdown, was initially declared on 23 March 2020 to last until 6 April 2020 (2), and was eventually lifted on 4 May 2020. The second nationwide lockdown started on 7 November 2020 with a first end date on 30 November 2020 (3). The lockdown was being continuously extended until it was fully lifted on 14 May 2021. 
In Q3 of 2020 no lockdown was in place, but all other measures, i.e. regulations on public gatherings or a night-time curfew, had a limit date (see also 5).

The last extension identified was via the Executive Decree nº PCM-050-2021, which extended the restrictions until May 9, 2021 [4]. However, there curfew measures that are still in place until June 20, 2021 [5]. This suggests that there are additional extensions that have not yet been published on the official website.

*Comments*:
 Hong Kong have taken several measures under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance. The main one in terms of affecting people’s democratic rights and every day life, and also the one addressed in terms of the start date for the regulations, is the 599G amendment that controls freedom of assembly and movement.  Initially, the 599G regulation was set to exist for three months (ending on June 29 2020), but was then extended and the expiration date for the regulation was set to 2020-12-31. It has again been extended and has the current end date of 2021-09-30. Measures taken within it, such as keeping or easing limitations on public gatherings, are made with shorter time intervals however, often in place around one week at a time. Other measures, such as closing business, has also had time limits, and no major restrictions imposed has been found to not have time limits in place.

 Article 38 of the Israeli constitution, Declaring a State of Emergency, states that the Knesset can declare a state of emergency for a maximum time limit of one year (with possibility of extension), and that the government can declare a state of emergency with the maximum time limit of 7 days (with the possiblity of extension, and the possible termination of the state of the emergency if the Knesset votes in favour of ending it). This state of emergency is the latter, declared by the government, and thus had an initial time limit of 7 days although they have extended it afterwards. Note that since July 21 2020, there's a new (temporary) law regulating state's of emergency that gives government extended powers during an SoE related to Covid-19, as well as the right to declare it for a longer time. See comments and sources under emleglimit for more information. It has been extended for 60 days a number of times, and the SoE is currently set to end on 2021-06-29.

 The Decree 2020-351 of 23 March 2020 (1) which declared a state of emergency, did not include a limit date, it only mentioned that this measure may be renewed if necessary. 
In some of the later Communiques by the Council of Ministers (see e.g. 2, 3), a limit date and extension fo the state of emergency is mentioned, but it hasn't been found for all. 
e.g. COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 04-29-2020: ''The Council adopted a decree extending the state of emergency. This decree, which is part of the implementation of the national response plan to the health crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, extends the state of emergency declared on 23 March 2020 throughout the national territory, for a new period from 1 to 15 May 2020.'' 
In the COUNCIL OF MINISTERS OF 09-30-2020 it is mentioned that ''the Council instructed the Minister of Health and all the Ministers concerned to maintain the health emergency until the end of December 2020, to continue the strategy of targeted screening and to protect patients, vulnerable and exposed people.'' (4). 

The state of health emergency, introduced on 21 January 2021, was initially declared until 28 February 2021 (see 5, 6). On 26 March 2021, the government extended the state of health emergency until 30 June 2021 (7, 8).

 Only one of the sources found on the state of emergency in Jordan report that there's a time limit on it (the Swedish Embassy), which states that it is initially imposed for two weeks with the possibility of extension. This is therefore coded as 1 in Q2 of 2020. However, as no evidence has been found of any time limits after this period, and that the SOE is in place without any officially declared end date being found, this is coded as 0 for all other periods.

 Q2 2020: Both the declaration of the state of emergency and its extensions had a time limit. The state of emergency was declared from 16 March until 15 April 2020, on 15 April it was extended until 1 May, and on 29 April it was extended until 11 May.

Q3 2020, Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021: measures implemented using the Law of Kazakhstan on public health and the healthcare system do not have a time limit, and were abolished when subsequent measures were passed.

For example, "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated August 15, 2020 No. 48 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" does not have a time limit and was abolished when "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated August 15, 2020 No. 48 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" was passed. The 15 August resolution does not have a time limit and was abolished when "Resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated October 23, 2020 No. 58 On restrictive quarantine measures and their gradual mitigation" was passed. Resolution from  23 October 2020 does not have a time limit, has been amended several times and is in place at the time of coding.

 The activation of the Public Health Act on 3 April 2020 did not have a limit date. At the General Powers Section of the Act, it mentions: 
''The Cabinet Secretary may, by notice in the Gazette and in General powers a newspaper with a wide circulation, put in place such measures as may from time to time become necessary to contain and curb the further spread of Covid-19.'' (see 1)

The Public Order (State Curfew) Order Act of 26 March 2020 (2), containing provisions for the countrywide curfew, was initially declared for a period of 30 days. All later extensions of the emergency measures had a limit date. 
The nationwide curfew has been extended several times since its introduction in March 2020 (and never been lifted). It is currently extended through 27 July 2021 (3).

 Emergency situation: no time limit in the decision to declare emergency situation, 30-day time limit in the announcement by the Prime Minister on the news section of the government website. No time limit in the legal framework (the Law on Civil Protection from 24 May 2018). On 9 May the President announced that emergency situation would be extended in a speech commemorating the anniversary of the end of World War II. The announcement from 10 May by the prime minister says that the emergency regime is still in place after the state of emergency in parts of the country has ended. OSCE report (p.162) says that "emergency situation" was declared for one month, was later renewed and is in place (the report was published on 17 July). I also found no evidence that the emergency situation has ended (e.g. local media reports that it is still in place). Since the official declaration of the emergency situation has no time limit (despite it being mentioned in the press statement), I coded emlimit as 0. According to Garda, " “On Friday, May 8, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov announced that the nationwide state of emergency currently in place due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic will be extended indefinitely. The state of emergency was originally introduced on Sunday, March 22.” (1)

State of emergency (part of the country): Chapter 2, Article 13 of the Constitution: 30 days limit for the whole country, 60 days for specific territories. Can be extended for the same period.  The state of emergency was extended and ended on 10 May 2020.

*Comments*:
 The decree was initially in effect up until April 19 2020, but it has been in continued use as measures taken under it were carried forward and other emergency measures that have been taken subsequently. While some announcement have included time limits, others have not, and there are several gaps where restrictions are active but no time limit has been found. Most recently, the restrictions were extended on June 4 2021, and will be in place at least until June 19 2021. However, the time limit for various measures is still unclear, as is whether there is a legally binding time limit on some or all measures. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 Pursuant under 23.2 of the Constitution, any declaration of state of emergency will expire automatically within 14 days without approval by the parliament for an extension of up to six months at a time (8). While one reference mentions the state of emergency extended by parliament for six months (until 18 October), local news reported the contrary (5,7). For this reason, to be conservative, we code the state of disaster from the 14-day expiration of the 15 April state of emergency. 

According to the Disaster Management Act 1997 section 2 - such a declaration of a state of disaster shall be in effect for the period specified in the declaration (9). No copy of the formal declaration in the Lesotho Gazette could be located. However, other sources indicate it was published in Legal Notice 40 of 2020, to be in effect from 29 April to 28 October 2020 (5). On 29 October, the new Prime Minister Moeketsi Majoro issued a declaration extending the state of disaster for another 6 months until 29 April 2021 (6). On April 28 2021, the state of disaster was extended until 30 October 2021 (10).

 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1). 

In January 2021, new measures including school closures were announced, but later eased in February. By the time of coding, some measures are still in place with last amendments occurring on 17 May 2021.

 Article 14, law 2017 055 of November 6, 2017 mentions that the state of emergency can be announced for a maximum period of one month, and then renewed only once for the same time (2). 
However, no limit date to the state of emergency was found for Q2 2020. 

Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, the Malian government declared a state of health emergency on 18 December 2020, to last initially for 10 days (until 28 December 2020). The government extended the state of health emergency on 23 December 2020 until 26 June 2021 (9, 10, 11).

 The activation of article 60 of the Constitution mentions that the ordinances may be taken during a limited period of time, but the Council of Ministers did not specify the length of this period. There is no indication that measures such as curfew had a time limit (1). 

''The Council examined and approved a draft enabling law authorizing the Government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances during a limited time, all the necessary measures, which are normally of the domain of the law, to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.'' (2).

 During 2020, the parliament approved a state of emergency for six months [1], which ended on 17 September 2020 [2]. Since then, the government has used the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015 to deal with Covid-19, brought into force on 17 September 2020 [3]. The emergency measures under this legal instrument have been amended several times [3,4], most recently on 16 June 2021 [5,6]. Each set of amendments clearly specified the time limit for the measures, most recently until 30 June 2021 [3,4,5,6].

*Comments*:
 Secondary sources typically mention time limits for most measures that have come into effect in Nepal during the Covid-19 pandemic. Researchers for this project were unable to confirm through official versions of the emergency measures because these could not be translated from Nepali prior to publication of the dataset. They are often posted to social media and government websites as scanned images. Therefore, we have decided to code this case a "1" because some evidence suggests that time limits exist. Nevertheless, the overall legal instrument in use has no time limit.

 When the President Issoufou Mahamadou declared a State of Emergency on 27 March 2020, he did not specify an end date (1, 2). The specific measures like the curfew and the closing of services had a limit date. Nevertheless, when the National Assembly approved the bill extending the state of emergency on 11 April 2020, a specifiied limit was added (11 July 2020) (3). 
All later extensions of the state of emergency had a limit date: 12 October 2020, 10 January 2021, 8 April 2021 and 5 August 2021. (see 4-8).

 For Q2 of 2020, the initial time limit of the Corona Act was 1 month. For the other periods, when using the using "Lov om vern mot smittsomme sykdommer [smittevernloven]" (the Act of 5 August 1994 No. 55 relating to control of communicable diseases) as the main legal instrument, no defined time limit or end date has been found for major restrictions such as limitations on assembly and private gatherings. No time limit has been found on the legal instrument itself either. This is therefore coded 0 for all other periods.

Likewise, a night curfew beginning on June 20, 2021 was imposed "until further notice" [3].

 The state of emergency was initially declared to be in place for two weeks, and did end after some extensions, the last one being set to 2020-06-16. The new emergency legislation, the National Pandemic Act, however is in effect and has no declared end date. This came into force in the late part of Q2 of 2020, and thus accounted for there as well (although the SoE had a declared end date, as noted above). For the Pandemic Act, measures under it can be active as long as a pandemic is declared under it. Therefore, there is currently no time limit to the emergency measures, but there was time limits under the initial state of emergency.

 The official statement announcing the state of epidemic says the state is in force until cancellation (based on order 491 from 20 March 2020, chapter 1, point 1). I found no time limit on the duration of the state of epidemic and the emergency measures in the order declaring a state of epidemic (Order 491 from 20 March 2020, 5). The emergency measures that apply for the duration of the state of epidemic are covid-19 related measures such as restrictions on movement (border crossing and similar) (Chapter 2), Restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing and use of certain items (masks, disinfectant and similar) (Chapter 3),  Restrictions on the functioning of certain institutions or workplaces (Chapter 4) , Prohibition of organizing shows and other gatherings of the population (Chapter 5), access to real estate, premises and areas provided for by anti-epidemic plans (Chapter 6). 

The state of epidemic was declared based on “the Act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused” (from 7 March 2020, 1), which amended “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases” (5 December 2008). According to Article 36 of the Act from 7 March, Articles 3-6 (on remote work, additional care allowance, airport regulations and procurement) and Articles 10-14 (on central government’s authority to give orders to local governments, changes to construction, tourism and transportation industries) a 180-day time limit and Article 31 (on budget transfers) has a 365-day time limit. The rest of the provisions (related to the “functioning of the health care system, telecommunication or state's Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations”, 2) amend existing regulations and are permanent changes to the “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases”.

According to OSCE report (3, p.36), "the end date of certain measures is uncertain." According to Democracy Reporting (4, p. 22), "The timing of these limitations is varied; some have been introduced with a set time limit and a  possibility of extension, some, like the ban on mass events, were introduced indefinitely."

The state of epidemic is also different from the state of emergency that has a 90-day time limit based on the Constitution (Article 230, point 1). While some specific emergency measures under a state of epidemic have a time limit, the state of epidemic was declared until further notice, therefore coded as 0.

 the first period of non-working days was declared from 30 March until 3 April (Decree 206 from 25 March 2020). It was then extended from 4 April until 30 April (Decree 239 from 2 April 2020). The third period of non-working days was declared from 6 until 8 May (Decree 294 from 28 April). Although the end date is 8 May, the following days (9-11 May) are official holidays in Russia, so de facto the period of non-working days was from 6 to 11 May 2020, and ended on 11 May 2020, as announced by President Putin.

The legal framework does not provide any time limit for emergency situation ("Mimoriadna situácia").

 Q2 2020, Q3 2020, Q4 2020: Most but not all measures have a time limit (in all time periods). 

For example, in March-June 2020: the decree restricting freedom of movement from 29 March 2020 had no time limit (Art.7), which was reviewed by the Constitutional Court (OSCE report. p.38). Moreover, according to European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, " On 29 May 2020, the government adopted decision, in effect from 1 June 2020, laying down that all adopted measures that have not been lifted by 1 June 2020 shall remain in force until they are amended or revoked, since there is still the risk of spread of the infection." (1)

In July-September 2020: the decree limiting public gatherings from 7 July 2020 had no time limit. According to a report by Democracy Reporting from 27 July, the implementation of the legal instrument in Slovenia has no explicit time limit.

In October-December 2020: the decree restricting freedom of movement from 27 November 2020 had no time limit. However, periodically some measures are extended continuously e.g. conditions of entry into the country.

Q1 2021, Q2 2021: I have not found any measures declared without a time limit.

 In Q2 of 2020, the  amendment was set to end on June 30 2020, and also did so.
For Q3 of 2020, no defined time limit in the decision to limit public gatherings to up to 50 people from 29 March 2020, which applied for this time period. As neither a central restriction nor the underlying legislation had an end date, this is coded as 0.
For Q4 of 2020, the decision to limit public gatherings to up to 8 people has a 4-week time limit. It came into force on 24 November and was initially set to expire on 22 December 2020. It was extended until the legislation was replaced with Covid-19 act, but continued to have a time limit. 
For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the Covid-19 Act is in use which is a temporary legislation that has an expiration date of 2021-09-30 at the time of writing. It is currently discussed to extend it to 2022-01-31, but no decision has been taken when this is coded.

 Time limit depends on the particular measures,sSome measures do not have a time limit. According to IDEA, "In late April, the Tajik Prime Minister’s COVID-19 Task Force cancelled all public events indefinitely. As of September, the prohibition is still in place. As of 19 October, mass gatherings and events remain prohibited. Private events are permitted for 30-40 people." (1) There is also no end date for the restictions on public events in the press release of the state news agency "Khovar" (no other legislation or official announcement on the President's website found). The measures have been in place in all time periods.

 A State of Public Emergency was declared on March 27, multiple times extended and expired July 22. Another State of Public Emergency was declared on August 5 and expired September 17. Both States of Public Emergency have/had an offically declared time limit. The measures based on The Public Health (Dangerous infectious Diseases) Protection Regulations, 2020 "will subsist for a period of 90 days subject to expert review and modification by the Health Minister at anytime", no end date is mentioned. No later end date has been found, and this is therefore coded as 0 for Q1 and Q2 of 2021 as well. Note however that Gambia since December 2020 has had few restrictions in place.

 The state of emergency was initially declared on 1 April 2020 for a three-month period (until early July 2020). It had been renewed twice, first on 3 July 2020 for 45 days (until 16 August 2020), and extended again to 15 September 2020.
The later extensions of the state of emergency all had a time limit (first until 16 August 2020, then 15 September 2020, 16 March 2021, and the final and current extension runs through 16 September 2021).

 Per law, powers by article 70 can only last max 2 months. Article 80 has no time limit unless the parliament wants to challenge the necessity of it.
Since Article 80 has no time limit, emlimit is coded 0.

*Comments*:
 Turkey has implemented several different and gradual measures in its Covid-19 emergency response. These were issued mainly through ministerial circulars, and the end date of most of them could not be found, or was announced later by the Minister of Interior. For instance, Turkey has announced that they will ease their restrictions as of May 2021, but no time limit for the current restrictions are set. This has been the case throughout the coded period, and generally the time limits of various measures have not been set. This is therefore coded 0 for all periods.

*Comments*:
 While some of the most extreme measures have had a time limit, not all of them do. Sections 11 and 27 in the "Public Health Act 1935" do not mention an time limit or sunset clause. Section 14 in the "Public Health (Control of COVID-19) Rules, 2020" states that "These Rules shall expire on notification by the Minister." The Public Health Act section 11 and 27 are still active and, according to the Uganda Legal Information Institute, the Public Health Rules 2020 are still in force. A state of emergency has a 90-day limit but the state of emergency has not been declared.

 The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020 was set to expire 6 months after it came into force. It was repealed and replaced on July 3. Its replacement, The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, also has an expiration date 6 months after it coming into force. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (SI 1200) of November 5 was due to expire on December 2 2020, while the SI 2020/1374 of December 2 expires on February 2 2021. This was subsequently extended to 31 of march 2021. It was replaced on March 29 with the current regulation titled Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021, which is currently set to expire on 2021-06-30.  This is therefore coded as 1.

 A national emergency under the National Emergency Act can only be declared for a year at a time, but can be extended. President Biden extended the national emergency on 2021-02-11, and it is thus set to end on 2022-03-01 currently. Note that national emergencies can be extended multiple times, and other national emergencies have been in place for several decades in the U.S.

While initially the statutory instruments came with specified time frames for restrictions, in May 2020, Public Health (COVID-19 Prevention, Containment and Treatment) (National Lockdown) (Amendment) Order, 2020 (No. 8) established that the restrictions would remain in place indefinitely subject to fortnightly review. The most recent amendments were made on 18 June 2021.
