*Comments*:
 The Algerian government initially adopted two main Decrees, on 21 March 2020 (1) and 24 March 2020 (2). Emstart is coded based on the date of the first decree because it included the more general and nationwide measures. The second decree was stricter (e.g. establishes confinement measures and restrictions), but its scope was mostly subnational.

*Comments*:
 On 27 March 2020, two enabling laws (1, 2) (special powers laws) were adopted in Belgium to deal with the pandemic, by enabling the King (i.e. the Belgian government) to adopt measures to control the spread of Covid-19 for a maximum period of three months starting on the day the laws entered into force, i.e. 30 March 2020. The two laws deal with the matters covered by Articles 74 (Covid-19 II) and 78 (Covid-19 I) of the Constitution.''
Based on the above, a series of Ministerial decrees are being updated and issued (for a full list of all Covid-19 related measures, and their end date, see (3)).

 The government proposed the amendment on March 12 2021, but it came into force on the 17 of March 2021. This amendment ended due to its sunset clause on March 1 2021, and was replaced with a permanent law. Thus, in Q2, there’s a new starting date signifying a new law.

 The State of Emergency was declared and came into effect on 2020-03-16. The Communicable Disease Act that manages the Covid-19 response after the SOE ended was in place previous to the pandemic, but it’s became the primary legal instrument when the SOE ended on 2020-06-16 and this is therefore set as the start date for the legal instrument.

*Comments*:
 On Monday 23 March 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a “health state of emergency,” declared for a period of two months from 24 March 2020 to 24 May 2020, which was extended until 10 July 2020, when it was eventually lifted. 
On 11 July 2020 a new law came into effect (LOI n° 2020-856 du 9 juillet 2020) that outlined the conditions for lifting  the state of health emergency and organizing the transition  period, valid between 11 July 2020 to 30 October 2020. 
Due to a second wave of Covid-19, the state of health emergency was re-instituted on 14 October 2020 initially by decree (6), and later on, on 5 November 2020, the Assemblée Nationale voted in favour of extending the state of emergency until 16 February 2021. 
 
The state of health emergency had been extended several times during 2021 and was due to expire on 16 February 2021. On 20 January 2021 the National Assembly gave the green light to extend the state of emergency until 1 June 2021. From 2 June 2021 the government will retain emergency powers until 31 October 2021 regarding the movement of people or the closure of shops if sanitary conditions require it. (12)

 For Q2-Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, there was no national-level emergency response. With the amendment of the Infection Protection Act on 2021-04-21, however, the German government created a national system for restrictions based on the extent of infections in each state. While the amendment was passed on 2021-04-21, it came into effect 2021-04-23, and this is therefore the starting date.

*Comments*:
 On 15 March 2020, President Akufo-Addo initially declared restrictions on public gatherings (for four months), the closure of schools (until further notice), as well as, enhanced hygiene procedures in public spaces and the observation of social distancing in business and workspaces [1]. While these restrictions took immediate effect, they came with reference to proposed emergency legislation, the Imposition of Restrictions Act, which did not come into force until 21 March 2020.  Following the adoption of the Imposition of Restrictions Act, the initial restrictions and all subsequent ones have been formalized through a series of Executive Instruments [2,3,4] and presidential speeches [5] with reference to this law. We therefore code the start date as 15 March, despite the legislation not being in effect until 21 March.

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution does not require an official invocation of Article 44. This legal instrument is therefore considered to have started being implemented from the date of the first package of measures, i.e. the date when the legal instrument was ''triggered''. 

The first ''Act of Legislative Content'' - with minimal measures to deal with Covid-19 - was passed by the greek government and then approved by the Parliament in 25 February 2020 (see Government Gazette: 2). The strictest measure, i.e. the first nationwide lockdown was implemented on 23 March 2020 (3) and lifted on 3 May 2020. The second lockdown was introduced in 7 November 2020 (4) and lifted on 14 May 2021. 
Consecutive Acts of Legislative Content and (Common) Ministerial Decisions have been issued during the pandemic. The government continues to use this legal instrument as of June 2021 (5 - 9). 

See a list of all Acts and Ministerial Decisions: 1.

 There has been a state of emergency in place throughout the coded period, but the SoE was initially based on Article 39 of the constitution. As of the passing of the Coronavirus Law on July 21 2020, this has been the legal instrument under which the SoE is based. Therefore, this has two different start dates, although an SoE in relation to Covid-19 has been in place throughout the coded period.

*Comments*:
 Kenya has introduced a combination of protocols and measures in place. The initial measures were implemented by a Presidential Directive on 15 March 2020,  but the legal instruments were activated later. Although the coronavirus disease was declared an infectious disease under the Public Health Act on 2 March 2020 (1), the first legal decision taken under this, hence the activation of the PHA, was on 3 April 2020 (2). 

The Public Order (State Curfew) Order Act that contained the strictest measures (curfew) was introduced earlier, on 26 March 2020 (in effect from 27 March 2020) (3). 

Emstart is coded based on the activation of the PHA as the main legal instrument.

*Comments*:
 On 01 April, the Ministry of Health declared Covid-19 a "formidable disease" under the Public Health Act. On 09 April 2020, the Minister of Health issued a set of rules for Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management (Government Notice No. 5 of 2020) (2). This document states that the Minister may extend the duration of lockdowns for one month at a time - but does not mention limits on the time for other emergency measures. On 07 August 2020, the Minister of Health issued a new set of guidelines that included a ban on public gatherings, with the exception of funerals under 50 people, closure of schools, mandatory mask wearing, among others. None of these regulations appear to have a defined end date (1). 

In 2021, several emergency measures remain in place. In January, an even harder lockdown was announced following the rise of coronavirus cases and later loosened in February. On 17 May some amendments were announced, but the main measures and restrictions are still in place.

*Comments*:
 Namibia declared a state of emergency on 17 March 2020 through the Proclamation 7/2020 (GG 7148) ''The Declaration of State of Emergency: National Disaster (COVID19)'', pursuant to Article 26(1) of the Namibian Constitution and to section 30(3) of the Disaster Risk Management Act, 2012 (Act No. 10 of 2012) [1,2]. This Proclamation was approved by the National Assembly as required by Article 26 of the Namibian Constitution on 20 March 2020, which also extended the state of emergency for 6 months [3].

After the expiration of the state of emergency on 17 September 2020, the government did not extend it further [4]. Instead, the authorities used the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015 to deal with Covid-19 regulations. The Act was brought into force on 17 September 2020 by GN 230/2020 (GG 7338). Regulations affecting movement, public gatherings, mask wearing, curfews, and alcohol sales are still being updated based on this legal instrument [5], and are currently in place through 30 June 2021 [6,7].

Note that emend is coded as 17 September 2020 for Q3 2020, because the state of emergency ended, which is the emlaw for that period. Nevertheless, emergency measures continued throughout the entire quarter under the Public and Environmental Health Act 1 of 2015.

*Comments*:
 The Senegalese President declared a state of emergency on 23 March 2020. After the state of emergency was lifted on 30 June the Senegalese government took various measures such as the mandatory wearing of face masks based on the Constitution and the powers related to the minister of Interior.

On 19 January 2021, the President of the Republic promulgated Law No. 2021-18 amending Law No. 69-29 of April 29, 1969 relating to the state of emergency and the state of siege. 
The parliament enacted amendments to loi no.69-29 of April 1969 to include a provision for declaration of state of disaster or health crisis. This has allowed the President to implement a response to Covid-19 under a more relevant legal regime as compared to the previous state of emergency. As a result, in 2021,  the same legal instrument is in place, as amended, but emlaw is now most accurately coded “2“. 
The ''state of health disaster'' was nitially declared on 5 January 2021 on two regions, where a night-time curfew was also announced (the capital Dakar and neighbouring Thies). 

Senegal lifted the state of emergency on 19 March 2021, after nearly three months, along which several other restrictions including the night time curfew. 
After the end of the state of emergency, some minimal Covid-19 health restrictions are maintained, like the wearing of face masks and social distancing measures.

 For Q2 of 2020, the amendment entered into force on 18 April 2020.
For Q3 and Q4 of 2020, where the Public Order Act is the main instrument, the Ordinance 2020:114 entered into force on 12 March 2020. Since measures in both time periods were passed as amendments to Ordinance 2020:114, 12 March 2020 is coded as the start date for both time periods.
For Q1 and Q2 of 2021, the Covid-19 Act was passed on January 8 2021 but came into effect on January 10 2021, and this is the date coded.

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1, 2 and 3) on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) based on the Constitution and the Epidemics Act of 28 September 2012. These Ordinaces were later validated by the Swiss Parliament with the Covid-19 Federal Act of September 25 2020.
The first Ordinance was imposed on February 28 2020, the second on March 13 2020 (expired on 22 June 2020), and the third on June 22 (in force through December 31, 2021). The second regulation contained and allowed farther reaching emergency measures compared to the first, and included the main response measures such as closing of shools and public places and curfews were taken. It is therefore the one taken as a start date. Since the passing of the Covid-19 Act, this is regarded the main legal instrument, and this is recorded as the start date from the time it was passed.

*Comments*:
 Turkey has used the Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442) as legal instruments to implement emergency response. The first significant legal measure undertaken was the closure of all schools and universities on March 23rd 2020. The first strict measure to affect daily life in Turkey have been those taken by the Ministry of Interior, who, on March 21 2020 declared a curfew for individuals who are sixty-five years or older, and anyone with a chronic illness, a measure that was executed nationwide as provincial Public Health Councils adopted identical decisions for curfew. This is therefore coded as the starting date.
