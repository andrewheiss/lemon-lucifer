- H~1~: States will be more likely to issue derogations during COVID-19 if they have strong rule of law.
- H~2~: Regime transitioning states, including backsliders, will be more likely to issue derogations.
- H~3~: If a state derogates from ICCPR, we expect that they will take the pandemic more seriously and be more likely to issue pandemic-related restrictions.
- H~4~: States experiencing democratic backsliding will be more likely to abuse human rights.
- H~5~: States experiencing democratic backsliding that also issue derogations will be less likely to abuse human rights than states that only backslide.

## Debt relief

### Quick interpretation

Non-backsliding states that derogated were more likely than non-derogating states to provide broad debt relief.

Backsliding states that didn't derogate had a nearly 100% chance of providing broad debt relief while those that derogated roughly match the patterns of non-backsliding derogating states.

For backsliders this is the reverse of the income support finding, but that's most likely because the handful of derogating backsliders all used the same policies: no income support, yes debt relief.

## Abusive enforcement

::: {.callout-tip}
### Quick interpretation

*This one is interesting and weird?*

Among non-backsliding states, derogation again matters, but it's less protective here than for the other human rights issues. Non-derogators have the highest probability of no abusive enforcement (75%ish), with low probabilities of higher levels. Derogators, on the other hand, see a lot more variation in abusive enforcement, with only a 50%ish percent chance of no abuse (and the other levels spread across the other 50%).

For backsliding states, the same pattern holds. Non-derogating backsliding states look basically like non-derogating non-backsliders, just with more uncertainty (with a 75%ish probability of no abusive enforcement). Derogating backsliders only have a 25%ish chance of no abuse—the other levels are spread across the remaining 75%.

Derogation enables more abusive enforcement?

## No time limited measures

::: {.callout-tip}
### Quick interpretation

For non-backsliders, among non-derogators there's a 75%ish chance of not not having time limited measures (i.e. having time limited measures; the good outcome); for derogators that jumps to 90%ish.

(This makes sense since derogations require specified time limits.)

For backsliders, there's a 100% chance of having time limited measures for both derogators and non-derogators.
