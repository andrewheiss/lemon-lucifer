## 🍋😈: Note on “lemon lucifer” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate an internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24).

codename(type = "gods", seed = "derogate backslides")
#> [1] "lemon lucifer"
```
