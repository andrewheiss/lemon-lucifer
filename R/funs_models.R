# Running modelsummary() on Bayesian models takes a while because of all the
# calculations involved in creating the GOF statistics. With modelsummary 0.7+,
# though it's now possible to build the base model with modelsummary(..., output
# = "modelsummary_list"), save that as an intermediate object, and then feed it
# through modelsummary() again with whatever other output you want. The
# modelsummary_list-based object thus acts like an output-agnostic ur-model.
