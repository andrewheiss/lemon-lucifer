  {"id":"BoyesEldredgeShannon:2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            States often use reservations to modify their treaty obligations. Prior research demonstrates why states enter reservations and why states object to reservations, but little work explains why states withdraw them. We argue that states withdraw reservations in response to international social pressure. Using novel data on reservations and reservation withdrawals for the nine core international human rights treaties, our analyses reveal two factors that compel states to withdraw reservations: (1) pressure from peer states and (2) pressure from human rights treaty bodies conducting periodic reviews. While previous work emphasizes domestic factors, our research shows that the international community encourages states to withdraw reservations and strengthen their commitments to human rights and international law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyes","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Eldredge","given":"Cody D."},{"family":"Shannon","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Zvobgo","given":"Kelebogile"}],"citation-key":"BoyesEldredgeShannon:2024","container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"Brit.

  {"id":"BushZetterberg:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            The global spread of electoral gender quotas has been characterized as one of the most significant institutional developments of the last 30 years. Many of the countries that have adopted these laws designed to increase women's political representation are electoral autocracies that have otherwise‐stark gender inequalities. Some scholars argue that electoral authoritarian states have adopted quotas as a strategy for improving their international reputations for democracy. This article represents the first exploration of whether quotas really generate reputational boosts. Using large‐scale survey experiments in Sweden and the United States concerning hypothetical developing countries, we find that they do. In particular, audiences perceived electoral autocracies as more democratic and were more likely to support giving them foreign aid when women's descriptive representation was greater. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of gender quotas and women's representation, this article contributes to broader debates about international reputation, human rights, and foreign aid attitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Bush","given":"Sarah Sunn"},{"family":"Zetterberg","given":"Pär"}],"citation-key":"BushZetterberg:2021","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"American J Political Sci","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12557","ISSN":"0092-5853, 1540-5907","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","page":"326-341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gender quotas and international reputation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12557","volume":"65"},

  {"id":"ChayesChayes:1993","abstract":"A new dialogue is beginning between students of international law and international relations scholars concerning compliance with international agreements. This article advances some basic propositions to frame that dialogue. First, it proposes that the level of compliance with international agreements in general is inherently unverifiable by empirical procedures. That nations generally comply with their international agreements, on the one hand, or that they violate them whenever it is in their interest to do so, on the other, are not statements of fact or even hypotheses to be tested. Instead, they are competing heuristic assumptions. Some reasons why the background assumption of a propensity to comply is plausible and useful are given. Second, compliance problems very often do not reflect a deliberate decision to violate an international undertaking on the basis of a calculation of advantage. The article proposes a variety of other reasons why states may deviate from treaty obligations and why in many circumstances those reasons are properly accepted by others as justifying apparent departures from treaty norms. Third, the treaty regime as a whole need not and should not be held to a standard of strict compliance but to a level of overall compliance that is \"acceptable\" in the light of the interests and concerns the treaty is designed to safeguard. How the acceptable level is determined and adjusted is considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Chayes","given":"Abram"},{"family":"Chayes","given":"Antonia Handler"}],"citation-key":"ChayesChayes:1993","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int Org","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818300027910","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"175-205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On compliance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0020818300027910/type/journal_article","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"Comstock:2021","abstract":"International treaties are the primary means for codifying global human rights standards. However, nation-states are able to make their own choices in how to legally commit to human rights treaties. A state commits to a treaty through four commitment acts: signature, ratification, accession, and succession. These acts signify diverging legal paths with distinct contexts and mechanisms for rights change reflecting legalization, negotiation, sovereignty, and domestic constraints. How a state moves through these actions determines how, when, and to what extent it will comply with the human rights treaties it commits to. Using legal, archival, and quantitative analysis this important book shows that disentangling legal paths to commitment reveals distinct and significant compliance outcomes. Legal context matters for human rights and has important implications for the conceptualization of treaty commitment, the consideration of non-binding commitment, and an optimistic outlook for the impact of human rights treaties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Comstock","given":"Audrey L."}],"citation-key":"Comstock:2021","DOI":"10.1017/9781108908979","ISBN":"978-1-108-90897-9 978-1-108-83007-2 978-1-108-82158-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,28]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Committed to rights: UN human rights treaties and legal paths for commitment and compliance","title-short":"Committed to Rights","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108908979/type/book"},

  {"id":"ComstockVilan:2024","abstract":"Although authoritarian regimes often repress the rights of women, many autocrats have committed to international treaties protecting women’s human rights. Scholars have typically overlooked this engagement, focusing instead on autocrats’ commitment (and violation) of treaties protecting civil, political, and physical integrity rights. Yet existing explanations for autocrats’ ratification of these treaties—such as appeasing domestic opposition groups—do not necessarily apply to women’s rights (von Stein 2013). As authoritarian international law is increasingly viewed as an important area of study (Ginsburg 2020), scholars should explore how authoritarian regimes navigate participation regarding women’s rights issues, including their engagement with the main women’s rights treaty, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). After taking a closer look at how autocracies shape, commit, and challenge women’s rights internationally, we suggest several research directions to build this area of study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Comstock","given":"Audrey L."},{"family":"Vilán","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"ComstockVilan:2024","container-title":"Politics & Gender","container-title-short":"Pol & Gen","DOI":"10.1017/S1743923X22000472","ISSN":"1743-923X, 1743-9248","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"223-228","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Looking beyond ratification: Autocrats’ international engagement with women’s rights","title-short":"Looking beyond Ratification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1743923X22000472/type/journal_article","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"CooleyNexon:2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            We live in a period of uncertainty about the fate of American global leadership and the future of international order. The 2016 election of Donald Trump led many to pronounce the death, or at least terminal decline, of liberal international order—the system of institutions, rules, and values associated with the American-dominated international system. But the truth is that the unraveling of American global order began over a decade earlier. Exit from Hegemony develops an integrated approach to understanding the rise and decline of hegemonic orders. It calls attention to three drivers of transformation in contemporary order. First, great powers, most notably Russia and China, contest existing norms and values while simultaneously building new spheres of international order through regional institutions. Second, the loss of the “patronage monopoly” once enjoyed by the United States and its allies allows weaker states to seek alternative providers of economic and military goods—providers who do not condition their support on compliance with liberal economic and political principles. Third, transnational counter-order movements, usually in the form of illiberal and right-wing nationalists, undermine support for liberal order and the American international system, including within the United States itself. Exit from Hegemony demonstrates that these broad sources of transformation—from above, below, and within—have transformed past international orders and undermine prior hegemonic powers. It provides evidence that all three are, in the present, mutually reinforcing one another and, therefore, that the texture of world politics may be facing major changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cooley","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Nexon","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"CooleyNexon:2020","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780190916473.001.0001","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-091647-3 978-0-19-005455-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exit from Hegemony: The Unraveling of the American Global Order","title-short":"Exit from Hegemony","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/33586"},

  {"id":"DaiTokhi:2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            One of the most influential arguments suggests that new democracies are more inclined than others to commit to international human rights treaties. This paper examines whether new democracies are more likely to commit not only to the basic, but also to the more demanding and constraining treaties. We argue that despite the strategic utility of costly commitments, new democracies are often unwilling to pay for the increased costs of more demanding and constraining treaties. We test our argument by tackling some of the trickiest inferential challenges. We employ propensity score weighting to address the nonrandom assignment of new democracies and further specify marginal structural models to account for dynamic confounding.

  {"id":"Davenport:1999","abstract":"Autocratization is expected to worsen human rights conditions; democratization is frequently heralded as a means for improving them. Unfortunately, neither relationship has been subjected to empirical investigation. The causal linkage between regime change and state repression is examined in the current study with a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis of 137 countries from 1950 to 1982 ( N=4,521). Four aspects of change are considered: (1) direction, (2) magnitude, (3) “smoothness” of the transition, and (4) duration of time at particular regime types. The results support the anticipated escalatory effect of autocratization for the magnitude variable, revealing influences that persist for 4 years. Additionally, there is support for the pacifying effect of democratization with regard to magnitude for the same 4-year time period. Direction, smoothness, and duration are found to be unimportant, but regime change does matter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Davenport","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"Davenport:1999","container-title":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","container-title-short":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","DOI":"10.1177/0022002799043001006","ISSN":"0022-0027, 1552-8766","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","page":"92-116","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Human rights and the democratic proposition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022002799043001006","volume":"43"},

This involves not only the abuse of the interpretation of rights, but also the abuse of the doctrine of unconstitutional constitutional amendments, which has spread around the world in recent years. How does this happen and what, if anything, can international law do about it? After introducing a motivating case — the famous decision of the Colombian Constitutional Court in the second re-election decision, in which courts stood for the protection of democracy — the chapter examines recent 'bad' cases in which rights and constitutional amendments are abused to extend leaders' terms. It surveys recent developments in the law of term limits, and briefly proposes a normative interpretation of the right to political participation which ought to be consistent with the emerging doctrine. The chapter suggests that there is an emerging consensus, at least in some regions of the world, that there are limits in states' ability to modify term limits unconditionally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ginsburg","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"Ginsburg:2021","container-title":"Constitutionalism","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780192896759.003.0007","editor":[{"family":"Linares Cantillo","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Valdivieso-León","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"García-Jaramillo","given":"Santiago"}],"event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-289675-9 978-0-19-191904-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"136-146","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The machinery of international law and democratic backsliding: The problem of term limits","title-short":"The Machinery of International Law and Democratic Backsliding","type":"chapter","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/40000/chapter/340327649"},
  {"id":"GrassePavlikMatfess:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Across the globe, states have attempted to contain COVID-19 by restricting movement, closing schools and businesses, and banning large gatherings. Such measures have expanded the degree of sanctioned state intervention into civilians' lives. But existing theories of preventive and responsive repression cannot explain why some countries experienced surges in repression after states in Africa initiated COVID-19-related lockdowns. While responsive repression occurs when states quell protests or riots, “opportunistic repression” arises when states use crises to suppress the political opposition. An examination of the relationship between COVID-19 shutdown policies and state violence against civilians in Africa tests this theory of opportunistic repression. Findings reveal a large and statistically significant relationship between shutdowns and repression, which holds after conditioning for the spread and lethality of the disease within-country and over time. A subnational case study of repression in Uganda provides evidence that the increase in repression appears to be concentrated in opposition areas that showed less support for Yoweri Museveni in the 2016 elections. Opportunistic repression provides a better explanation than theories of preventive or responsive repression for why Uganda experienced a surge in repression in 2020 and in what areas. The results have implications for theories of repression, authoritarian survival, the politics of emergency, and security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Grasse","given":"Donald"},{"family":"Pavlik","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Matfess","given":"Hilary"},{"family":"Curtice","given":"Travis B."}],"citation-key":"GrassePavlikMatfess:2021","container-title":"International Security","DOI":"10.1162/isec_a_00419","ISSN":"0162-2889, 1531-4804","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"language":"en","page":"130-165","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Opportunistic repression: Civilian targeting by the state in response to COVID-19","title-short":"Opportunistic Repression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/46/2/130/107696/Opportunistic-Repression-Civilian-Targeting-by-the","volume":"46"},

Using publicly available documentation, we systematically analyze the patterns of the CPC's external relations since the early 2000s. Building on an intense travel diplomacy, the ID-CPC maintains a widely stretched network to political elites across the globe. The ID-CPC's engagement is not new; but since Xi Jinping took office, the CPC has bolstered its efforts to reach out to other parties. We find that party relations not only serve as an additional channel to advance China's foreign policy interests. Since President Xi has come to power, party relations also emerged as a key instrument to promote China's vision for reforming the global order. Moreover, China increasingly uses the party channel as a vehicle of authoritarian learning by sharing experiences of its economic modernization and authoritarian one-party regime. The cross-regional analysis of the CPC's engagement with other parties helps us to better understand the role of the CPC in Chinese foreign policy-making, pointing to a new research agenda at the intersection of China's foreign relations, authoritarian diffusion, and transnational relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hackenesch","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Bader","given":"Julia"}],"citation-key":"HackeneschBader:2020","container-title":"International Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.1093/isq/sqaa028","ISSN":"0020-8833, 1468-2478","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"723-733","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The struggle for minds and influence: The Chinese Communist Party's global outreach","title-short":"The Struggle for Minds and Influence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/64/3/723/5855278","volume":"64"},

To remedy this deficiency in the literature we use cross-validation and random forests to determine the\n              predictive\n              power of measures of concepts the literature identifies as important causes of repression. We find that few of these measures are able to substantially improve the predictive power of statistical models of repression. Further, the most studied concept in the literature, democratic political institutions, predicts certain kinds of repression much more accurately than others. We argue that this is due to conceptual and operational overlap between democracy and certain kinds of state repression. Finally, we argue that the impressive performance of certain features of domestic legal systems, as well as some economic and demographic factors, justifies a stronger focus on these concepts in future studies of repression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Zachary M."}],"citation-key":"HillJones:2014","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am Polit Sci Rev","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055414000306","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"661-687","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An empirical evaluation of explanations for state repression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003055414000306/type/journal_article","volume":"108"},

From the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index to the Financial Action Task Force blacklist, global performance indicators (GPIs) are increasingly deployed to influence governance globally. We argue that GPIs derive influence from their ability to frame issues, extend the authority of the creator, and — most importantly — to invoke recurrent comparison that stimulates governments' concerns for their own and their country's reputation. Their public and ongoing ratings and rankings of states are particularly adept at capturing attention not only at elite policy levels but also among other domestic and transnational actors. GPIs thus raise new questions for research on politics and governance globally. What are the social and political effects of this form of information on discourse, policies and behavior? What types of actors can effectively wield GPIs and on what types of issues?

  {"id":"LittleMeng:2024","abstract":"ABSTRACT\n            Despite the general narrative that the world is in a period of democratic decline, there have been surprisingly few empirical studies that assess whether this is systematically true. Most existing studies of global backsliding are based largely if not entirely on subjective indicators that rely on expert coder judgment. Our study surveys objective indicators of democracy (e.g., incumbent performance in elections) and finds little evidence of global democratic decline during the past decade. To explain the discrepancy in trends between expert-coded and objective indicators, we consider the role of coder bias and leaders strategically using more subtle undemocratic action. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the world is becoming less democratic exclusively in ways that require subjective judgment to detect, this claim is not justified by existing evidence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Little","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Meng","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"LittleMeng:2024","container-title":"PS: Political Science & Politics","container-title-short":"APSC","DOI":"10.1017/S104909652300063X","ISSN":"1049-0965, 1537-5935","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"149-161","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measuring democratic backsliding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S104909652300063X/type/journal_article","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"LuhrmannRooney:2021","abstract":"States of emergency grant chief executives the power to bypass democratic constraints in order to combat existential threats. As such, they are ideal tools to erode democratic institutions while maintaining the illusion of constitutional legitimacy. Therefore, states of emergency should  be associated with a heightened risk of autocratization – a decline in a regime's democratic attributes. Despite this theoretical link and the contemporary relevance of both autocratization and states of emergency, no prior study has empirically tested this relationship. This article tests this relationship using data on sixty democracies for 1974 to 2016. We find  that democracies are 75 percent more likely to erode under a state of emergency. This evidence strongly suggests that states of emergency circumvent democratic processes in ways that might promote democratic decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lührmann","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rooney","given":"Bryan"}],"citation-key":"LuhrmannRooney:2021","container-title":"Comparative Politics","container-title-short":"comp polit","DOI":"10.5129/001041521X16004520146485","ISSN":"0010-4159","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"617-649","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Autocratization by decree: States of emergency and democratic decline","title-short":"Autocratization by Decree","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.5129/001041521X16004520146485","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"Meyerrose:2020","abstract":"Since the end of the Cold War, international organizations (IOs) have engaged in unprecedented levels of democracy promotion, and research overwhelmingly links them to positive democratic outcomes. However, this increased emphasis on democracy has more recently been accompanied by rampant illiberalism and a sharp rise in cases of democratic backsliding in new democracies. What explains democratic backsliding in an age of unparalleled international support for democracy? Backsliding occurs when democratic institutions are weakened or eroded by elected officials, resulting in an illiberal or diminished form of democracy. I argue that IOs that support democracy unintentionally make backsliding more likely by neglecting to promote democratic institutions other than executives and elections, increasing executive power, and limiting states’ domestic policy options, which stunts institutional development. I find membership in IOs associated with democracy promotion makes backsliding more likely, decreases checks on executive power, and limits domestic policy options and party development in new democracies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyerrose","given":"Anna M."}],"citation-key":"Meyerrose:2020","container-title":"Comparative Political Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0010414019897689","ISSN":"0010-4140, 1552-3829","issue":"10-11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1547-1581","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The unintended consequences of democracy promotion: International organizations and democratic backsliding","title-short":"The Unintended Consequences of Democracy Promotion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414019897689","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"Moravcsik:2000","abstract":"Most formal international human rights regimes establish international committees and courts that hold governments accountable to their own citizens for purely internal activities. Why would governments establish arrangements so invasive of domestic sovereignty? Two views dominate the literature. “Realist” theories assert that the most powerful democracies coerce or entice weaker countries to accept norms; “ideational” theories maintain that transnational processes of diffusion and persuasion socialize less-democratic governments to accept norms. Drawing on theories of rational delegation, I propose and test a third “republican liberal” view: Governments delegate self-interestedly to combat future threats to domestic democratic governance. Thus it is not mature and powerful democracies, but new and less-established democracies that will most strongly favor mandatory and enforceable human rights obligations. I test this proposition in the case of the European Convention on Human Rights—the most successful system of formal international human rights guarantees in the world today. The historical record of its founding—national positions, negotiating tactics, and confidential deliberations—confirms the republican liberal explanation. My claim that governments will sacrifice sovereignty to international regimes in order to dampen domestic political uncertainty and “lock in” more credible policies is then generalized theoretically and applied to other human rights regimes, coordination of conservative reaction, and international trade and monetary policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Moravcsik","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Moravcsik:2000","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int Org","DOI":"10.1162/002081800551163","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"217-252","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The origins of human rights regimes: Democratic delegation in postwar Europe","title-short":"The Origins of Human Rights Regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0020818300440993/type/journal_article","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"VonStein:2016","abstract":"This article argues that in order to understand how international human rights agreements (HRAs) work, scholars need to turn their attention to rights that are not definitional to democracy. When rights practices diverge from treaty rules, but the domestic enforcement mechanisms that give such agreements their bite are robust, how do governments behave? The study explores this question by examining a core treaty that prohibits child labor. When domestic enforcement is likely, states where many children work are often deterred from ratifying. Nevertheless, those that do ratify experience significant child labor improvements. By contrast, in non-democracies, ratification is a promise that is easily made but seldom kept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Von Stein","given":"Jana"}],"citation-key":"VonStein:2016","container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"Brit.

  {"id":"WaldnerLust:2018","abstract":"Scholars have paid increasing attention to democratic backsliding, yet efforts to explain this phenomenon remain inchoate. This article seeks to place the study of democratic backsliding on sturdier conceptual, operational, and theoretical foundations. Conceptually, the challenge of backsliding is to define changes that take place within a political regime. Methodologically, the challenge involves measurement of intraregime changes, as alternative coding schemes change the population of units that have experienced democratic backsliding. Theoretical challenges are dual: First, despite a rich and diverse literature, we lack readily available theories to explain backsliding, and second, the theoretical debates that do exist—centered on the causes of democratic transitions, democratic breakdowns, authoritarian resilience, and democratic consolidation—remain unresolved. We consider how these theories might be called into service to explain backsliding. By doing so, the article aims to set the terms of the debate to create a common focal point around which research can coalesce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Waldner","given":"David"},{"family":"Lust","given":"Ellen"}],"citation-key":"WaldnerLust:2018","container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.
